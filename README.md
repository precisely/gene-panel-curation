Gene Panel Curation
===================

This repository contains human-curated content for various parts of
the precise.ly platform.

The Curation Guidelines on the GitHub repo wiki (itself a repo)
contains information on how the folders and files are named,
organized, and how to add content.

All text files should be in either YAML or so-called "precise.ly
MarkDown", or PMD files, to allow for human editing and
machine-reading/processing of the content.
