# Introduction

This mutation is a change at a specific point in the GRIK3 gene from thymine (T) to guanine (G), resulting in incorrect protein formation. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

# What does this mean?

GRIK3 Ser310Ala polymorphism has been linked to schizophrenia and major depression.[3][5]  The Ser310Ala allele in homozygosity is associated with higher scores in harm avoidance anticipatory worry, and shyness, with lower scores in exploratory excitability, responsibility, resourcefulness, helpfulness, compassion, self-directedness, and cooperativeness.[4] This pattern of scores is akin to that observed in depressed patients.[4]  GRIK3 rs6691840 polymorphism was found to increase the risk of schizophrenia by 30%.[3][9]  Microdeletions have also been indicated in severe developmental delays.[2]

# What should I do about this?

CFS is linked to improper Glutamate:GABA balance, as well as exposure to extracellular glutamate caused by neuroinflammatory stimuli.  Complementary dietary supplemental regimes may include: Omega-3 PUFAs, CoQ10, N-acetylcysteine, vitamin B12, curcumin, zinc, magnesium, L-Taurine, and L-carnetine.[10]
