# Introduction

This mutation is a change at a specific point in the MTHFR gene from
adenine (A) to cytosine (T), resulting in reduced enzymatic
activity. This subsitution of a single nucleotide is known as a
missense mutation.

# Mild loss of function

People with the following variants have a slightly reduced effiency of processing folate (82% of normal).

# What should I do about this?

Some people with mild loss of function variant may benefit from supplementing their diets with folate. Consult your physician.

# Moderate loss of function

People with the following variants have a reduced effiency of processing folate (30% of normal).

# What should I do about this?

Most people with moderate loss of function variant may benefit from supplementing their diets with folate. Consult your physician.

# Severe Loss of Function

People with the following mutations have a drastically reduced
efficiency of processing folate (15% of normal), as well as 
elevated levels of homocysteine levels have been associated with low
thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism), chronic conditions like obesity,
diabetes, high cholesterol, physical inactivity, and high blood
pressure. However, very high homocysteine levels rarely result from
having the common variants alone.

# What should I do about this?

It is strongly recommended that people in this group take folate
supplement on a daily basis. You should also be carefully evaluated
for other factors known to affect homocysteine, such as:

* eye lens dislocations
* unusual (Marfan type) body shape
* stroke
* blood clotting abnormalities
* Low thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism)
