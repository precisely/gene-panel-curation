# What does the COMT gene do?

The TRPM8 gene encodes a cation channel that allows the movement of sodium, potassium, calcium, and cesium across plasma barriers activated by [low temperatures](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14757700?dopt=Abstract).  It allows the body to detect [temperature
changes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17217067), respond to cold, balance calcium in the body, and feel the cooling effects of menthol.   Variants in TRPM8 are associated with [breast](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20482834), [pancreatic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27038374), [lung](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24037916), and [prostate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25065497) cancer.  Additional issues include increased susceptibility to [metabolic syndrome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25967713), [migraines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23294458?dopt=Abstract), [alcohol dependence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23942779?dopt=Abstract), [COPD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27789940), [pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22072275?dopt=Abstract) and [cold sensitivity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21542321?dopt=Abstract), [asthma](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26272603), and [inflammation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26660531).  Other variants reduce natural killer cell function in the immune system and are associated with [CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524).

# Normal Function

The normal dopamine levels allow for good [pain tolerance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12595695?dopt=Abstract) and better thinking under stress.  However, thinking ability is reduced in normal circumstances. It may also reduce the chance of nicotine dependence in Asian males and African American females.  Other issues include:

* [1.4X increased risk of breast cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18194538?dopt=Abstract)
* [2X risk of schizophrenia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15866551?dopt=Abstract)
* [Alcohol-dependency]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22208661?dopt=Abstract)
* [Greater risk of psychotic symptoms and schizophrenia when using cannabis]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22208661?dopt=Abstract) 
* [Poor response to the antidepressant paroxetine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18989660?dopt=Abstract)

# What should I do about this?

Consider using other antidepressant medications than paroxetine.  Do not drink alcohol or use cannabis.

Medications indicated for use in treating COMT issues include: [Clonidine, BIA, Diethylstilbestrol, Dobutamine, Dopamine, Entacapone, Methyldopa, Micafungin, Nialamide,  S-Adenosylmethionine,  Testosterone Propionate, and Tolcapone.](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P21964#pathology_and_biotech)

<# G158A (A;G) #>

# Moderate Loss of Function

This variant decreases COMT enzymatic activity by as much as 25% and increases dopamine levels. It also decreases the [pain tolerance with higher pain ratings](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12595695?dopt=Abstract) and increased sensitivity to [thermal and pressure pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22528689?dopt=Abstract).   Although it causes worse thinking under stress, information processing is better than average under non-stressful conditions. Other issues include:
* [Greater COMT gene activation after moderate exercise causing muscle fatigue and pain.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19647494)
* Higher risk of daytime [sleepiness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23728717?dopt=Abstract)
* Higher risk of metabolic syndrome for women taking antipsychotics like [clozapine ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24448899?dopt=Abstract)
* [Intermediate response to antidepressant paroxetine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18989660?dopt=Abstract)
* [Increased susceptibility for cocaine dependence]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18704099?dopt=Abstract)
* Greater risk for [nicotine dependence]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16395295?dopt=Abstract) in Asian males and African American females
* [ 1.3X increased risk of breast cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18194538?dopt=Abstract)

# What should I do about this?

To improve cognition, people should avoid stress and consider [meditation, tai-chi, yoga, and stretching](https://medlineplus.gov/stress.html#cat_78). Avoid moderate levels of exercise, and practice pacing or monitoring to reduce muscle fatigue and pain. Consider medications other than clozapine and paroxetine, and avoid cocaine and nicotine. People should be checked regularly for breast cancer and consider [drinking green tea](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19074205?dopt=Abstract)

Medications indicated for use in treating COMT issues include: [Clonidine, BIA, Diethylstilbestrol, Dobutamine, Dopamine, Entacapone, Methyldopa, Micafungin, Nialamide,  S-Adenosylmethionine,  Testosterone Propionate, and Tolcapone.](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P21964#pathology_and_biotech)


<# G158A (A;A) #>

# Severe Loss of Function

The (A) substitution polymorphism changes the amino acid to a methionine, reducing enzymatic activity by 25% and greatly increasing dopamine levels.  [78% of AA experience chronic pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21120493?dopt=Abstract) compared to 28% of the general population, and the [pain threshold](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12595695?dopt=Abstract) is greatly reduced.  Although [thinking is very poor under stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12595695?dopt=Abstract), information processing is better than average under non-stressful conditions.  

This variant also is more common in [CFS patients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21059181).  After excercise, the COMT gene showed [more activation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22110941) than healthy patients.  CFS patients have [higher cortisol levels, enhanced IgE, diminished IgG3 levels, and an increased susceptibility to respiratory tract infections](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26272340). It is linked to increased [POTS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21059181) during tilt table testing in CFS patients, daytime [sleepiness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23728717?dopt=Abstract), and fatigue. 

Other issues include:

* [Greatest COMT gene activation after moderate exercise causing muscle fatigue and pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19647494)
* Highest sensitivity to [thermal and pressure pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22528689?dopt=Abstract) and worst [psychological and functional response to pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21895373?dopt=Abstract)
* [10.4% increase in homocysteine and increased risk of venous thrombosis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18064318?dopt=Abstract)
* Highest risk of metabolic syndrome for women taking antipsychotics like [clozapine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24448899?dopt=Abstract)
* [Highest susceptibility for cocaine dependence]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18704099?dopt=Abstract)
* Greatest chance of [nicotine dependence]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16395295?dopt=Abstract) in Asian males and African American females

# What should I do about this?

* Avoid all stress and moderate exercise to improve pain sensitivity, muscle fatigue and thinking. Consider using [meditation, tai-chi, yoga, and stretching](https://medlineplus.gov/stress.html#cat_78)
* Consider using [light therapy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23728717?dopt=Abstract) to regulate sleep.
* Do not use antipsychotics like clozapine, nicotine, or cocaine.
* Avoid taking [clonidine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27457818), which is linked to lower numbers of daily steps, porr sleep quality, and low quality of life.
* To relieve POTS, remain well hydrated and take [3-5g of salt daily.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2600095/)
* Check homocysteine levels, and consider taking [folate]( https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/1017.html) if elevated.
* Check [IgE and IgG3 levels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26272340). If IgG deficiency is caused by immunodeficiency, consider [early use of antibiotics](http://www.piduk.org/static/media/up/IgG%20subclass%20Patient%20Information%20Sheet.pdf) and a home supply of antibiotics.  For patients with frequent severe infections, regular [low dose (prophylactic) antibiotics]( http://www.piduk.org/static/media/up/IgG%20subclass%20Patient%20Information%20Sheet.pdf) may prevent development of infections.
* Check [cortisol levels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26272340).  If elevated consider [magnesium](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18500945), [Omega-3 fish oil]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12909818), [massage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16162447), [Withania somnifera (ashwagandha) root extract](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23439798), and [high-dose vitamin C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11862365).

<# T19960814C TC; T19960814C CC #>

# Severe Risk

This variant has a variety of effects:
* Much more common in [CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19772600) patients.  
* Lower scores in [attention tests, memory tests, and executive function](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27091610).  
* Incorrect metabolism of [Tacrolimus]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24465960), a widely used immunosuppressive drug.  
* Increased [cold pain sensitivity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19559388) in women.  
* Protective against [type 2 diabetes]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25927430).  

# What should I do about this?

Be careful if taking [Tacrolimus]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24465960).  Avoid cold temperatures or temperature shock.

<# T19960814C TT #>

# Normal Function

Although this is the wildtype form, it is associated with a greater incidence of [type 2 diabetes mellitus]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25927430).  Risk factors to develop diabetes include being [overweight, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, an inactive lifestyle, heart attack or stroke, depression, PCOS, and smoking](https://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventdiabetes.html).

# What should I do about this?

* Test your [blood sugar levels](https://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventdiabetes.html to monitor diabetes risk).  
* If overweight, lose [weight](https://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventdiabetes.html and keep it off). 
* Follow a [healthy eating plan](https://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventdiabetes.html) with less fat and sugar, a large amount of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, and minimal red and processed meats.
* [Exercise](https://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventdiabetes.html) 30 minutes 5 days a week.  
* Do not [smoke](https://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventdiabetes.html).

# High Risk

This variant is associated with an increased risk of [CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19540336) as well as [major depressive disorder with melancholic features](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19540336).  This variant is associated with increased “oxidative stress,” which is caused by [free radicals](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/antioxidants/introduction.htm) triggering cell damage. The increased risk of oxidative stress also leads to [cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21716162).

# What should I do about this?

Oxidative stress may be mitigated through environmental changes, [antioxidants](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/antioxidants/introduction.htm), and dietary changes.
* Avoid [ionizing radiation, smoking, metals, and high oxygen atmospheres](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/antioxidants-fact-sheet#q1). 
* Consider a diet higher in [antioxidants, including vitamins C and E, and selenium, as well as carotenoids, such as beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/antioxidants/introduction.htm).
* Consider eating [red and purple berries like blueberries and cranberries, orange and dark, leafy green veggies like pumpkin and spinach, tomato, red grapes, and peanuts](https://www.fruitsandveggiesmorematters.org/what-are-phytochemicals).
