# What does the COMT gene do?

The COMT gene creates an enzyme that helps break down and balance levels of dopamine and [norepinephrine](https://www.britannica.com/science/norepinephrine) in nerve cells. It also helps balance levels of [estrogen](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18324659?dopt=Abstract) in the liver, kidneys, and blood. Variants may cause [anxiety](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16232322?dopt=Abstract), [depression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19520435?dopt=Abstract), muscle pain and fatigue, oxidative stress, and [reduced pain tolerance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22528689?dopt=Abstract). They are linked to [endometrial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18324659?dopt=Abstract) and [breast](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18194538?dopt=Abstract) cancer, [schizophrenia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22208661?dopt=Abstract), [endometriosis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24965973), [alcoholism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22208661?dopt=Abstract), and [nicotine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16395295?dopt=Abstract) dependency. This gene is located on chromosome 22.

# What are some common variants of COMT?
 
A variant is a change at a specific point in the gene from the expected nucleotide sequence to another, resulting in incorrect enzyme function. There are five common variants in COMT: [G158A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21059181), [C62T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26891941), [T19943884C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19540336), [T19960814C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19772600), and [T19950010G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19540336).

    # What does this mean?

    People with this variant have one copy of the [G158A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21059181) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    This variant decreases COMT enzymatic activity by as much as 25% and increases dopamine levels. It also decreases the [pain tolerance with higher pain ratings](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12595695?dopt=Abstract) and increased sensitivity to [thermal and pressure pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22528689?dopt=Abstract). Although it causes worse thinking under stress, information processing is better than average under non-stressful conditions. Other issues include:

    - [Greater COMT gene activation after moderate exercise causing muscle fatigue and pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19647494) 
    - Higher risk of daytime [sleepiness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23728717?dopt=Abstract) 
    - Higher risk of metabolic syndrome for women taking antipsychotics like [clozapine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24448899?dopt=Abstract) 
    - [Intermediate response to antidepressant paroxetine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18989660?dopt=Abstract) 
    - [Increased susceptibility for cocaine dependence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18704099?dopt=Abstract) 
    - Greater risk for [nicotine dependence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16395295?dopt=Abstract) in Asian males and African American females 
    - [1.3X increased risk of breast cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18194538?dopt=Abstract) 

    # What should I do about this?

    To improve cognition, people should avoid stress and consider [meditation, tai-chi, yoga, and stretching](https://medlineplus.gov/stress.html#cat_78). Avoid moderate levels of exercise, and practice pacing or monitoring to reduce muscle fatigue and pain. Consider medications other than clozapine and paroxetine, and avoid cocaine and nicotine. People should be checked regularly for breast cancer and consider [drinking green tea.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19074205?dopt=Abstract)

    Medications indicated for use in treating COMT issues include: [Clonidine, BIA, Diethylstilbestrol, Dobutamine, Dopamine, Entacapone, Methyldopa, Micafungin, Nialamide, S-Adenosylmethionine, Testosterone Propionate, and Tolcapone.](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P21964#pathology_and_biotech)

    # What does this mean?

    People with this variant have two copies of the [G158A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21059181) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    The double adenine (A) missense variant reduces enzyme activity by 25% and greatly increases dopamine levels. [78% of people experience chronic pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21120493?dopt=Abstract) compared to 28% of the general population, and the associated [pain threshold](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12595695?dopt=Abstract) is greatly reduced. Although [thinking is very poor under stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12595695?dopt=Abstract), information processing is better than average under non-stressful conditions.

    This variant also is more common in [ME/CFS patients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21059181) and has many effects.

    -  After exercise, the COMT gene showed [more activation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22110941) than healthy patients, [causing muscle fatigue and pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19647494) 
    -  CFS patients have [higher cortisol levels, enhanced IgE, diminished IgG3 levels, and an increased susceptibility to respiratory tract infections](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26272340) 
    - Increased postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome ([POTS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21059181)) during tilt table testing 
    - Daytime [sleepiness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23728717?dopt=Abstract) 
    - Increased fatigue. 

    Other issues include:

    - [Greatest COMT gene activation after moderate exercise causing muscle fatigue and pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19647494) 
    - Highest sensitivity to [thermal and pressure pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22528689?dopt=Abstract) and worst [psychological and functional response to pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21895373?dopt=Abstract) 
    - [10.4% increase in homocysteine and increased risk of venous thrombosis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18064318?dopt=Abstract) 
    - Highest risk of metabolic syndrome for women taking antipsychotics like [clozapine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24448899?dopt=Abstract) 
    - [Highest susceptibility for cocaine dependence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18704099?dopt=Abstract) 
    - Greatest chance of [nicotine dependence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16395295?dopt=Abstract) in Asian males and African American females 

    # What should I do about this?

    - Avoid all stress and moderate exercise to improve pain sensitivity, muscle fatigue and thinking. Consider [meditation, tai-chi, yoga, and stretching.](https://medlineplus.gov/stress.html#cat_78) 
    - Consider using [light therapy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23728717?dopt=Abstract) to regulate sleep. 
    - Do not use antipsychotics like clozapine, nicotine, or cocaine. 
    - Avoid taking [clonidine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27457818), which is linked to lower numbers of daily steps, poor sleep quality, and low quality of life. 
    - To relieve postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), remain well hydrated and take [3-5g of salt daily.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2600095/) 
    - Check homocysteine levels, and consider taking [folate](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/1017.html) if elevated. 
    - Check [IgE and IgG3 levels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26272340). If IgG deficiency is caused by immunodeficiency, consider [early use of antibiotics](http://www.piduk.org/static/media/up/IgG%20subclass%20Patient%20Information%20Sheet.pdf) and a home supply of antibiotics. For patients with frequent severe infections, regular [low dose (prophylactic) antibiotics](http://www.piduk.org/static/media/up/IgG%20subclass%20Patient%20Information%20Sheet.pdf) may prevent development of infections. 
    - Check [cortisol levels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26272340). If elevated, consider [magnesium](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18500945), [omega-3 fish oil](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12909818), [massage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16162447) therapy, [Withania somnifera (ashwagandha) root extract](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23439798), and [high-dose vitamin C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11862365).

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    COMT’s estrogen detoxification function is slightly impaired, causing higher than normal levels of estrogen in the body. This may increase the risk for [endometrial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18324659?dopt=Abstract) and [breast cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18194538?dopt=Abstract). Slightly high [estrogen levels](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682922.html) may increase the risk for heart problems and memory problems, and [symptoms](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682922.html) may include headaches, dizziness, and problems with thinking or memory. 

    Female patients with ME/CFS may have [abnormal ovarian function](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9790489) worsened by COMT variants, including polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), hirsutism, and cysts. This may [increase the risk for ME/CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9790489) due to continued estrogen function and higher estrogen levels in the body. Higher levels may also be related to ME/CFS related malformed [estrogen receptors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16731592). The excess estrogen damages the ability of progesterone to aid and modulate the immune system during the menstrual cycle.

    # What should I do about this?

    - Regularly check for endometrial and breast cancer. 
    - Consult with your doctor to ensure you maintain normal estrogen levels. 
    - Drinking green tea may [reduce risk of breast cancer.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19074205?dopt=Abstract)

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    In estrogen metabolic pathways, the COMT enzyme is related to detoxification. The TT genotype is [2.39X](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18324659?dopt=Abstract) more common in endometrial cancer patients as compared to the general population. The impaired detoxification pathway may increase the risk for [endometrial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18324659?dopt=Abstract) and [breast cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18194538?dopt=Abstract).

    # What does this mean?

    People with this variant have one copy of the [T19943884C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19540336) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    This variant is associated with increased “oxidative stress,” which is caused by [free radicals](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/antioxidants/introduction.htm) triggering cell damage. The increased risk of oxidative stress also leads to [cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21716162). ME/CFS patients often show [increased oxidative stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27580693) that can be measured as increased levels of [thiobarbituric acid reactive substances](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19457057) (TBARS), an oxidative stress blood marker, and decreased [reduced ascorbic-acid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19457057) (RAA), an antioxidant defense marker. This is associated with [increased symptom severity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29065167) and muscle weakness.

    # What should I do about this?

    Oxidative stress may be mitigated through environmental changes, [antioxidants](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/antioxidants/introduction.htm), and dietary changes.

    - [Robuvit](https://www.robuvit.com/home/)® (oak wood extract) is effective in reducing [oxidative stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29164838) and [fatigue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29719945), while improving cognition, sleep, and memory. Consider taking [300mg/day](https://www.minervamedica.it/en/journals/sports-med-physical-fitness/article.php?cod=R40Y2018N05A0678). 
    - Avoid [ionizing radiation, smoking, metals, and high oxygen atmospheres](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/antioxidants-fact-sheet#q1). 
    - Consider a diet higher in [antioxidants, including vitamins C and E, and selenium, as well as carotenoids, such as beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/antioxidants/introduction.htm). 
    - Consider eating [red, blue, purple berries like blueberries and cranberries, orange and dark, leafy green vegetables like pumpkin and spinach, tomato, red grapes, and peanuts](https://www.fruitsandveggiesmorematters.org/what-are-phytochemicals)."

This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

    # What is the effect of this variant?
   
    There is currently no data on the interaction between these variants.  However, some information exists on variants individually and the gene generally.
    
    Female patients with ME/CFS may have [abnormal ovarian function](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9790489) worsened by COMT variants, including polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), hirsutism, and cysts. This may [increase the risk for ME/CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9790489) due to continued estrogen function and higher estrogen levels in the body. Higher levels may also be related to ME/CFS related malformed [estrogen receptors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16731592). The excess estrogen damages the ability of progesterone to aid and modulate the immune system during the menstrual cycle.

    Other variants are associated with increased “oxidative stress,” which is caused by [free radicals](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/antioxidants/introduction.htm) triggering cell damage.

    You have some combination of the following variants: [G158A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21059181), [C62T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26891941), [T19943884C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19540336), [T19960814C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19772600), and [T19950010G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19540336). This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

    # What is the effect of this variant?
   
    There is currently no data on the interaction between these variants.  However, some information exists on variants individually and the gene generally.
    
    Female patients with ME/CFS may have [abnormal ovarian function](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9790489) worsened by COMT variants, including polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), hirsutism, and cysts. This may [increase the risk for ME/CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9790489) due to continued estrogen function and higher estrogen levels in the body. Higher levels may also be related to ME/CFS related malformed [estrogen receptors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16731592). The excess estrogen damages the ability of progesterone to aid and modulate the immune system during the menstrual cycle.

    Other variants are associated with increased “oxidative stress,” which is caused by [free radicals](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/antioxidants/introduction.htm) triggering cell damage. The increased risk of oxidative stress also leads to [cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21716162). ME/CFS patients often show [increased oxidative stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27580693) that can be measured as increased levels of [thiobarbituric acid reactive substances](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19457057) (TBARS), an oxidative stress blood marker, and decreased [reduced ascorbic-acid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19457057) (RAA), an antioxidant defense marker. This is associated with [increased symptom severity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29065167) and muscle weakness.
    
    # What should I do about this?
    
    Oxidative stress may be mitigated through environmental changes, [antioxidants](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/antioxidants/introduction.htm), and dietary changes.

    - [Robuvit](https://www.robuvit.com/home/)® (oak wood extract) is effective in reducing [oxidative stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29164838) and [fatigue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29719945), while improving cognition, sleep, and memory. Consider taking [300mg/day](https://www.minervamedica.it/en/journals/sports-med-physical-fitness/article.php?cod=R40Y2018N05A0678). 
    - Avoid [ionizing radiation, smoking, metals, and high oxygen atmospheres](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/antioxidants-fact-sheet#q1). 
    - Consider a diet higher in [antioxidants, including vitamins C and E, and selenium, as well as carotenoids, such as beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/antioxidants/introduction.htm). 
    - Consider eating [red, blue, and purple berries like blueberries and cranberries, orange and dark, leafy green vegetables like pumpkin and spinach, tomato, red grapes, and peanuts](https://www.fruitsandveggiesmorematters.org/what-are-phytochemicals).
    
    - Regularly check for endometrial and breast cancer. 
    - Consult with your doctor to ensure you maintain normal estrogen levels. 
    - Drinking green tea may [reduce risk of breast cancer.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19074205?dopt=Abstract) 

    Medications related to COMT include: [Clonidine, BIA, Diethylstilbestrol, Dobutamine, Dopamine, Entacapone, Methyldopa, Micafungin, Nialamide, S-Adenosylmethionine, Testosterone Propionate, and Tolcapone.](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P21964#pathology_and_biotech)

    Female patients with ME/CFS may have [abnormal ovarian function](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9790489) worsened by COMT variants, including polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), hirsutism, and cysts. This may [increase the risk for ME/CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9790489) due to continued estrogen function and higher estrogen levels in the body. Higher levels may also be related to ME/CFS related malformed [estrogen receptors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16731592). The excess estrogen damages the ability of progesterone to aid and modulate the immune system during the menstrual cycle.

    Other variants are associated with increased “oxidative stress,” which is caused by [free radicals](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/antioxidants/introduction.htm) triggering cell damage. The increased risk of oxidative stress also leads to [cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21716162). ME/CFS patients often show [increased oxidative stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27580693) that can be measured as increased levels of [thiobarbituric acid reactive substances](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19457057) (TBARS), an oxidative stress blood marker, and decreased [reduced ascorbic-acid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19457057) (RAA), an antioxidant defense marker. This is associated with [increased symptom severity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29065167) and muscle weakness.
    
    # What should I do about this?
    
    Oxidative stress may be mitigated through environmental changes, [antioxidants](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/antioxidants/introduction.htm), and dietary changes.

    - [Robuvit](https://www.robuvit.com/home/)® (oak wood extract) is effective in reducing [oxidative stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29164838) and [fatigue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29719945), while improving cognition, sleep, and memory. Consider taking [300mg/day](https://www.minervamedica.it/en/journals/sports-med-physical-fitness/article.php?cod=R40Y2018N05A0678). 
    - Avoid [ionizing radiation, smoking, metals, and high oxygen atmospheres](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/antioxidants-fact-sheet#q1). 
    - Consider a diet higher in [antioxidants, including vitamins C and E, and selenium, as well as carotenoids, such as beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/antioxidants/introduction.htm). 
    - Consider eating [red, blue, and purple berries like blueberries and cranberries, orange and dark, leafy green vegetables like pumpkin and spinach, tomato, red grapes, and peanuts](https://www.fruitsandveggiesmorematters.org/what-are-phytochemicals).
    
    - Regularly check for endometrial and breast cancer. 
    - Consult with your doctor to ensure you maintain normal estrogen levels. 
    - Drinking green tea may [reduce risk of breast cancer.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19074205?dopt=Abstract) 

    Medications related to COMT include: [Clonidine, BIA, Diethylstilbestrol, Dobutamine, Dopamine, Entacapone, Methyldopa, Micafungin, Nialamide, S-Adenosylmethionine, Testosterone Propionate, and Tolcapone.](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P21964#pathology_and_biotech)

Consider taking [300mg/day](https://www.minervamedica.it/en/journals/sports-med-physical-fitness/article.php?cod=R40Y2018N05A0678). 
    - Avoid [ionizing radiation, smoking, metals, and high oxygen atmospheres](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/antioxidants-fact-sheet#q1). 
    - Consider a diet higher in [antioxidants, including vitamins C and E, and selenium, as well as carotenoids, such as beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/antioxidants/introduction.htm). 
    - Consider eating [red, blue, and purple berries like blueberries and cranberries, orange and dark, leafy green vegetables like pumpkin and spinach, tomato, red grapes, and peanuts](https://www.fruitsandveggiesmorematters.org/what-are-phytochemicals).
    
    - Regularly check for endometrial and breast cancer. 
    - Consult with your doctor to ensure you maintain normal estrogen levels.

    You have some combination of the following variants: [G158A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21059181), [C62T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26891941), [T19943884C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19540336), [T19960814C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19772600), and [T19950010G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19540336). This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

    # What is the effect of this variant?
   
    There is currently no data on the interaction between these variants.  However, some information exists on variants individually and the gene generally.
    
    Female patients with ME/CFS may have [abnormal ovarian function](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9790489) worsened by COMT variants, including polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), hirsutism, and cysts. This may [increase the risk for ME/CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9790489) due to continued estrogen function and higher estrogen levels in the body. Higher levels may also be related to ME/CFS related malformed [estrogen receptors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16731592). The excess estrogen damages the ability of progesterone to aid and modulate the immune system during the menstrual cycle.

    Other variants are associated with increased “oxidative stress,” which is caused by [free radicals](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/antioxidants/introduction.htm) triggering cell damage. The increased risk of oxidative stress also leads to [cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21716162). ME/CFS patients often show [increased oxidative stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27580693) that can be measured as increased levels of [thiobarbituric acid reactive substances](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19457057) (TBARS), an oxidative stress blood marker, and decreased [reduced ascorbic-acid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19457057) (RAA), an antioxidant defense marker. This is associated with [increased symptom severity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29065167) and muscle weakness.

    # What does this mean?

    You have some combination of the following variants: [G158A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21059181), [C62T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26891941), [T19943884C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19540336), [T19960814C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19772600), and [T19950010G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19540336). This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

    # What is the effect of this variant?
   
    There is currently no data on the interaction between these variants.  However, some information exists on variants individually and the gene generally.
    
    Female patients with ME/CFS may have [abnormal ovarian function](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9790489) worsened by COMT variants, including polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), hirsutism, and cysts. This may [increase the risk for ME/CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9790489) due to continued estrogen function and higher estrogen levels in the body. Higher levels may also be related to ME/CFS related malformed [estrogen receptors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16731592). The excess estrogen damages the ability of progesterone to aid and modulate the immune system during the menstrual cycle.

    Other variants are associated with increased “oxidative stress,” which is caused by [free radicals](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/antioxidants/introduction.htm) triggering cell damage. The increased risk of oxidative stress also leads to [cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21716162). ME/CFS patients often show [increased oxidative stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27580693) that can be measured as increased levels of [thiobarbituric acid reactive substances](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19457057) (TBARS), an oxidative stress blood marker, and decreased [reduced ascorbic-acid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19457057) (RAA), an antioxidant defense marker. This is associated with [increased symptom severity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29065167) and muscle weakness.
    
    # What should I do about this?
    
    Oxidative stress may be mitigated through environmental changes, [antioxidants](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/antioxidants/introduction.htm), and dietary changes.

    - [Robuvit](https://www.robuvit.com/home/)® (oak wood extract) is effective in reducing [oxidative stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29164838) and [fatigue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29719945), while improving cognition, sleep, and memory. Consider taking [300mg/day](https://www.minervamedica.it/en/journals/sports-med-physical-fitness/article.php?cod=R40Y2018N05A0678). 
    - Avoid [ionizing radiation, smoking, metals, and high oxygen atmospheres](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/antioxidants-fact-sheet#q1). 
    - Consider a diet higher in [antioxidants, including vitamins C and E, and selenium, as well as carotenoids, such as beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/antioxidants/introduction.htm). 
    - Consider eating [red, blue, and purple berries like blueberries and cranberries, orange and dark, leafy green vegetables like pumpkin and spinach, tomato, red grapes, and peanuts](https://www.fruitsandveggiesmorematters.org/what-are-phytochemicals).
    
    - Regularly check for endometrial and breast cancer.

    # What does this mean?

    You have some combination of the following variants: [G158A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21059181), [C62T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26891941), [T19943884C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19540336), [T19960814C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19772600), and [T19950010G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19540336). This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

    # What is the effect of this variant?
   
    There is currently no data on the interaction between these variants.  However, some information exists on variants individually and the gene generally.
    
    Female patients with ME/CFS may have [abnormal ovarian function](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9790489) worsened by COMT variants, including polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), hirsutism, and cysts. This may [increase the risk for ME/CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9790489) due to continued estrogen function and higher estrogen levels in the body. Higher levels may also be related to ME/CFS related malformed [estrogen receptors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16731592). The excess estrogen damages the ability of progesterone to aid and modulate the immune system during the menstrual cycle.

    Other variants are associated with increased “oxidative stress,” which is caused by [free radicals](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/antioxidants/introduction.htm) triggering cell damage. The increased risk of oxidative stress also leads to [cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21716162). ME/CFS patients often show [increased oxidative stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27580693) that can be measured as increased levels of [thiobarbituric acid reactive substances](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19457057) (TBARS), an oxidative stress blood marker, and decreased [reduced ascorbic-acid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19457057) (RAA), an antioxidant defense marker. This is associated with [increased symptom severity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29065167) and muscle weakness.
    
    # What should I do about this?
    
    Oxidative stress may be mitigated through environmental changes, [antioxidants](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/antioxidants/introduction.htm), and dietary changes.

    - [Robuvit](https://www.robuvit.com/home/)® (oak wood extract) is effective in reducing [oxidative stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29164838) and [fatigue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29719945), while improving cognition, sleep, and memory. Consider taking [300mg/day](https://www.minervamedica.it/en/journals/sports-med-physical-fitness/article.php?cod=R40Y2018N05A0678). 
    - Avoid [ionizing radiation, smoking, metals, and high oxygen atmospheres](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/antioxidants-fact-sheet#q1). 
    - Consider a diet higher in [antioxidants, including vitamins C and E, and selenium, as well as carotenoids, such as beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/antioxidants/introduction.htm). 
    - Consider eating [red, blue, and purple berries like blueberries and cranberries, orange and dark, leafy green vegetables like pumpkin and spinach, tomato, red grapes, and peanuts](https://www.fruitsandveggiesmorematters.org/what-are-phytochemicals).
    
    - Regularly check for endometrial and breast cancer. 
    - Consult with your doctor to ensure you maintain normal estrogen levels. 
    - Drinking green tea may [reduce risk of breast cancer.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19074205?dopt=Abstract) 

    Medications related to COMT include: [Clonidine, BIA, Diethylstilbestrol, Dobutamine, Dopamine, Entacapone, Methyldopa, Micafungin, Nialamide, S-Adenosylmethionine, Testosterone Propionate, and Tolcapone.](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P21964#pathology_and_biotech)

    There is currently no data on the interaction between these variants.  However, some information exists on variants individually and the gene generally.
    
    Female patients with ME/CFS may have [abnormal ovarian function](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9790489) worsened by COMT variants, including polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), hirsutism, and cysts. This may [increase the risk for ME/CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9790489) due to continued estrogen function and higher estrogen levels in the body. Higher levels may also be related to ME/CFS related malformed [estrogen receptors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16731592). The excess estrogen damages the ability of progesterone to aid and modulate the immune system during the menstrual cycle.

    # What is the effect of G158A (G;G)?

    The normal dopamine levels allow for good [pain tolerance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12595695?dopt=Abstract) and better thinking under stress. However, thinking ability is reduced in normal circumstances. It may also reduce the chance of nicotine dependence in Asian males and African American females. Other issues include:

    - [1.4X increased risk of breast cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18194538?dopt=Abstract) 
    - [2X risk of schizophrenia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15866551?dopt=Abstract) 
    - [Alcohol-dependency](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22208661?dopt=Abstract) 
    - [Greater risk of psychotic symptoms and schizophrenia when using cannabis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22208661?dopt=Abstract) 
    - [Poor response to the antidepressant paroxetine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18989660?dopt=Abstract) 

    # What should I do about this?

    Consider using other antidepressant medications than paroxetine. Do not drink alcohol or use cannabis.
