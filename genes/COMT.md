# What does the COMT gene do?

The TRPM8 gene encodes a cation channel that allows the movement of sodium, potassium, calcium, and cesium across plasma barriers activated by [low temperatures](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14757700?dopt=Abstract).  It allows the body to detect [temperature
changes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17217067), respond to cold, balance calcium in the body, and feel the cooling effects of menthol.   Variants in TRPM8 are associated with [breast](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20482834), [pancreatic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27038374), [lung](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24037916), and [prostate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25065497) cancer.  Additional issues include increased susceptibility to [metabolic syndrome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25967713), [migraines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23294458?dopt=Abstract), [alcohol dependence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23942779?dopt=Abstract), [COPD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27789940), [pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22072275?dopt=Abstract) and [cold sensitivity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21542321?dopt=Abstract), [asthma](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26272603), and [inflammation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26660531).  Other variants reduce natural killer cell function in the immune system and are associated with [CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524).

# Normal Function

The normal dopamine levels allow for good [pain tolerance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12595695?dopt=Abstract) and better thinking under stress.  However, thinking ability is reduced in normal circumstances. It may also reduce the chance of nicotine dependence in Asian males and African American females.  Other issues include:

# Moderate loss of function

This variant decreases COMT enzymatic activity by as much as 25% and increases dopamine levels. It also decreases the [pain tolerance with higher pain ratings](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12595695?dopt=Abstract) and increased sensitivity to [thermal and pressure pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22528689?dopt=Abstract).   Although it causes worse thinking under stress, information processing is better than average under non-stressful conditions. Other issues include:
* [Greater COMT gene activation after moderate exercise causing muscle fatigue and pain.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19647494)
* Higher risk of daytime [sleepiness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23728717?dopt=Abstract)

# What should I do about this?

To improve cognition, people should avoid stress and consider [meditation, tai-chi, yoga, and stretching](https://medlineplus.gov/stress.html#cat_78). Avoid moderate levels of exercise, and practice pacing or monitoring to reduce muscle fatigue and pain. Consider medications other than clozapine and paroxetine, and avoid cocaine and nicotine. People should be checked regularly for breast cancer and consider [drinking green tea](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19074205?dopt=Abstract)

It is also linked to [CFS and POTS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21059181) during tilt table testing, and daytime [sleepiness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23728717?dopt=Abstract) and fatigue. Other issues include:

* [Greatest COMT gene activation after moderate exercise causing muscle fatigue and pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19647494)
* Highest sensitivity to [thermal and pressure pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22528689?dopt=Abstract) and worst [psychological and functional response to pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21895373?dopt=Abstract)
* [10.4% increase in homocysteine and increased risk of venous thrombosis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18064318?dopt=Abstract)
* Highest risk of metabolic syndrome for women taking antipsychotics like [clozapine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24448899?dopt=Abstract)
* [Highest susceptibility for cocaine dependence]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18704099?dopt=Abstract)
* Greatest chance of [nicotine dependence]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16395295?dopt=Abstract) in Asian males and African American females

# What should I do about this?

* Avoid all stress and moderate exercise to improve pain sensitivity, muscle fatigue and thinking. Consider using [meditation, tai-chi, yoga, and stretching](https://medlineplus.gov/stress.html#cat_78)
* To relieve POTS, remain well hydrated and take [3-5g of salt daily.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2600095/)
* Consider using [light therapy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23728717?dopt=Abstract) to regulate sleep.
* Check homocysteine levels, and consider taking [folate]( https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/1017.html) if elevated
* Do not use antipsychotics like clozapine, nicotine, or cocaine.

# Moderate risk

In estrogen metabolic pathways, the COMT enzyme is related to detoxification.  The slightly impaired detoxification pathway may increase the risk for [endometrial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18324659?dopt=Abstract) and [breast cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18194538?dopt=Abstract).


# What should I do about this?

* Regularly check for endometrial and breast cancer.
* Consult with your doctor to ensure you maintain normal estrogen levels.
* [Drink green tea](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19074205?dopt=Abstract)

# High Risk

In estrogen metabolic pathways, the COMT enzyme is related to detoxification. The TT genotype is [2.39X](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18324659?dopt=Abstract) more common in endometrial cancer patients as compared to the general population.  The impaired detoxification pathway may increase the risk for [endometrial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18324659?dopt=Abstract) and [breast cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18194538?dopt=Abstract).


# What should I do about this?

* Regularly check for endometrial and breast cancer.
* Consult with your doctor to reduce elevated estrogen levels
* [Maintain a healthy weight, get adequate sleep, limit alcohol, avoid radiation](https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/basic_info/prevention.htm), and [drink green tea](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19074205?dopt=Abstract)
