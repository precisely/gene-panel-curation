# What does the COMT gene do?

The COMT gene creates an enzyme that helps break down and balance levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in nerve cells. It also detoxifies [estrogen](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18324659?dopt=Abstract) in the liver, kidneys, and blood. Variants may cause [anxiety](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16232322?dopt=Abstract), [depression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19520435?dopt=Abstract), muscle pain and fatigue, and [reduced pain tolerance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22528689?dopt=Abstract). They are linked to [endometrial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18324659?dopt=Abstract) and [breast](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18194538?dopt=Abstract) cancer, [schizophrenia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22208661?dopt=Abstract), [endometriosis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24965973), [alcoholism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22208661?dopt=Abstract), and [nicotine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16395295?dopt=Abstract) dependency.

This gene is located on chromosome 22. The enzyme it creates acts in your brain, nervous system, liver, kidney, and blood.

# Normal Function

Although this is the wild-type form with no variants, it is associated with a greater incidence of [type 2 diabetes mellitus]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25927430). Risk factors to develop diabetes include being [overweight, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, an inactive lifestyle, heart attack or stroke, depression, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and smoking](https://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventdiabetes.html).

# What should I do about this?

* Test your [blood sugar levels](https://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventdiabetes.html) to monitor diabetes risk. 
* If overweight, lose [weight](https://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventdiabetes.html) and keep it off. 
* Follow a [healthy eating plan](https://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventdiabetes.html) with less fat and sugar, a large amount of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, and minimal red and processed meats.
* [Exercise](https://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventdiabetes.html) 30 minutes 5 days a week. 
* Do not [smoke](https://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventdiabetes.html).

# Normal Function

The normal dopamine levels allow for good [pain tolerance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12595695?dopt=Abstract) and better thinking under stress. However, thinking ability is reduced in normal circumstances. It may also reduce the chance of nicotine dependence in Asian males and African American females. Other issues include:

* [1.4X increased risk of breast cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18194538?dopt=Abstract)
* [2X risk of schizophrenia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15866551?dopt=Abstract)
* [Alcohol-dependency]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22208661?dopt=Abstract)
* [Greater risk of psychotic symptoms and schizophrenia when using cannabis]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22208661?dopt=Abstract) 
* [Poor response to the antidepressant paroxetine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18989660?dopt=Abstract)

# What should I do about this?

Consider using other antidepressant medications than paroxetine. Do not drink alcohol or use cannabis.

Medications indicated for use in treating COMT issues include: [Clonidine, BIA, Diethylstilbestrol, Dobutamine, Dopamine, Entacapone, Methyldopa, Micafungin, Nialamide, S-Adenosylmethionine, Testosterone Propionate, and Tolcapone.](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P21964#pathology_and_biotech)

| :-------------: |:-------------:|
| G158A (A;G)  | 49.9% |

# Moderate Loss of Function

This variant decreases COMT enzymatic activity by as much as 25% and increases dopamine levels. It also decreases the [pain tolerance with higher pain ratings](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12595695?dopt=Abstract) and increases sensitivity to [thermal and pressure pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22528689?dopt=Abstract).  Although it causes worse thinking under stress, information processing is better than average under non-stressful conditions. Other issues include:
* [Greater COMT gene activation after moderate exercise causing muscle fatigue and pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19647494)
* Higher risk of daytime [sleepiness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23728717?dopt=Abstract)
* Higher risk of metabolic syndrome for women taking antipsychotics like [clozapine ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24448899?dopt=Abstract)
* [Intermediate response to antidepressant paroxetine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18989660?dopt=Abstract)
* [Increased susceptibility for cocaine dependence]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18704099?dopt=Abstract)
* Greater risk for [nicotine dependence]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16395295?dopt=Abstract) in Asian males and African American females
* [ 1.3X increased risk of breast cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18194538?dopt=Abstract)

# What should I do about this?

To improve cognition, people should avoid stress and consider [meditation, tai-chi, yoga, and stretching](https://medlineplus.gov/stress.html#cat_78). Avoid moderate levels of exercise, and practice pacing or monitoring to reduce muscle fatigue and pain. Consider medications other than clozapine and paroxetine, and avoid cocaine and nicotine. People should be checked regularly for breast cancer and consider [drinking green tea](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19074205?dopt=Abstract)

Medications indicated for use in treating COMT issues include: [Clonidine, BIA, Diethylstilbestrol, Dobutamine, Dopamine, Entacapone, Methyldopa, Micafungin, Nialamide, S-Adenosylmethionine, Testosterone Propionate, and Tolcapone.](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P21964#pathology_and_biotech)

| G158A (A;A)  | 24.4% |

# Severe Loss of Function

The double adenine (A) missense variant changes the amino acid to a methionine, reducing enzymatic activity by 25% and greatly increasing dopamine levels. [78% of people with A;A experience chronic pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21120493?dopt=Abstract) compared to 28% of the general population, and the associated  [pain threshold](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12595695?dopt=Abstract) is greatly reduced. Although [thinking is very poor under stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12595695?dopt=Abstract), information processing is better than average under non-stressful conditions. 

This variant also is more common in [CFS patients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21059181). After excercise, the COMT gene in CFS patients showed [more activation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22110941) than in healthy patients. CFS patients have [higher cortisol levels, enhanced IgE levels, diminished IgG3 levels, and an increased susceptibility to respiratory tract infections](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26272340). It is linked to increased [postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21059181) during tilt table testing in CFS patients, daytime [sleepiness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23728717?dopt=Abstract), and fatigue. 

Other issues include:

* [Greatest COMT gene activation after moderate exercise causing muscle fatigue and pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19647494)
* Highest sensitivity to [thermal and pressure pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22528689?dopt=Abstract) and worst [psychological and functional response to pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21895373?dopt=Abstract)
* [10.4% increase in homocysteine, and increased risk of venous thrombosis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18064318?dopt=Abstract)
* Highest risk of metabolic syndrome for women taking antipsychotics like [clozapine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24448899?dopt=Abstract)
* [Highest susceptibility for cocaine dependence]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18704099?dopt=Abstract)
* Greatest chance of [nicotine dependence]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16395295?dopt=Abstract) in Asian males and African American females

# What should I do about this?

* Avoid all stress and moderate exercise to improve pain sensitivity, muscle fatigue and thinking. Consider using [meditation, tai-chi, yoga, and stretching.](https://medlineplus.gov/stress.html#cat_78)
* Consider using [light therapy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23728717?dopt=Abstract) to regulate sleep.
* Do not use antipsychotics like clozapine, nicotine, or cocaine.
* Avoid taking [clonidine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27457818), which is linked to lower numbers of daily steps, poor sleep quality, and low quality of life.
* To relieve postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), remain well hydrated, and take [3-5g of salt daily.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2600095/)
* Check homocysteine levels, and consider taking [folate]( https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/1017.html) if elevated.
* Check [IgE and IgG3 levels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26272340). If IgG deficiency is caused by immunodeficiency, consider [early use of antibiotics](http://www.piduk.org/static/media/up/IgG%20subclass%20Patient%20Information%20Sheet.pdf) and a home supply of antibiotics. For patients with frequent severe infections, regular [low dose (prophylactic) antibiotics]( http://www.piduk.org/static/media/up/IgG%20subclass%20Patient%20Information%20Sheet.pdf) may prevent development of infections.
* Check [cortisol levels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26272340). If elevated consider [magnesium](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18500945), [omega-3 fish oil]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12909818), [massage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16162447), [Withania somnifera (ashwagandha) root extract](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23439798), and [high-dose vitamin C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11862365).

| T19950010G (T;G) | 37.5%     |

# Moderate Risk

This variant is associated with increased “oxidative stress,” which is caused by [free radicals](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/antioxidants/introduction.htm) triggering cell damage. The increased risk of oxidative stress also leads to [cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21716162).

# What should I do about this?

Oxidative stress may be mitigated through environmental changes, [antioxidants](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/antioxidants/introduction.htm), and dietary changes.
* Avoid [ionizing radiation, smoking, metals, and high oxygen atmospheres](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/antioxidants-fact-sheet#q1). 
* Consider a diet higher in [antioxidants, including vitamins C and E, and selenium, as well as carotenoids, such as beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/antioxidants/introduction.htm).
* Consider eating [ red, blue, purple berries like blueberries and cranberries, orange and dark, leafy green vegetables like pumpkin and spinach, tomato, red grapes, and peanuts](https://www.fruitsandveggiesmorematters.org/what-are-phytochemicals).

| T19960814C (C;C)  | 18.5%      |

# Severe Risk

This variant has a variety of effects:
* Much more common in [CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19772600) patients. 
* Lower scores in [attention tests, memory tests, and executive function](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27091610). 
* Incorrect metabolism of [Tacrolimus]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24465960), a widely used immunosuppressive drug. 
* Increased [cold pain sensitivity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19559388) in women. 
* Protective against [type 2 diabetes]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25927430). 

# What should I do about this?

Be careful if taking [Tacrolimus]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24465960). Avoid cold temperatures and temperature shock.
