# Gene symbol 
COMT
# Full name of gene
catechol-O-methyltransferase 

# What does the <gene_symbol> gene do?
The COMT gene creates the catechol-O-methyltransferase enzyme.  The enzyme created by nerve cells helps break down and balance levels of dopamine and norepinephrine.  The enzyme produced in the liver, kidneys, and blood helps control hormone levels.  COMT has been associated with schizophrenia, reduced pain tolerance, breast cancer, endometriosis, alcohol and nicotine dependence, anxiety, and depression.  
 
This gene is located on chromosome 22. The enzyme it creates acts in your brain and nervous system.

# What are some common mutations of <gene_symbol>?

There are 2 well known variants in this gene: <variant list?>

<G158A variant view with G to A transformation>

This variant is a change at a specific point in the <gene_symbol> gene from guanine (G) to adenine (A), resulting in reduced enzyme activity. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.

<C62T variant view with C to T transformation>

This mutation is a change at a specific point in the <gene_symbol> gene from cytosine (C) to thymine (T), resulting in reduced protein creation.  This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a mis-sense mutation.

# What are the effects of variants in <gene_symbol>?

For the vast majority of people, the overall risk associated with the common <gene_symbol> variants is small, and do not impact treatment. It is possible that variants in this gene interact with other gene variants, which is the reason for our inclusion of this gene in the gene panel.

# Normal Function

Warrior. Val, less exploratory, higher COMT enzymatic activity, therefore lower dopamine levels; higher pain threshold, better stress resiliency, albeit with a modest reduction in executive cognition performance under most conditions

# Moderate loss of function

the (A) substitution polymorphism changes the amino acid to a methionine. This alters the structure of the resultant enzyme such that its activity is only 25% of the wild type. As a result, A allele carriers have more dopamine in their prefrontal cortex
Worrier. Met, more exploratory, lower COMT enzymatic activity, therefore higher dopamine levels; lower pain threshold, enhanced vulnerability to stress, yet also more efficient at processing information under most conditions
