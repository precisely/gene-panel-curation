# What are some common mutations of C5orf66?
 
There is one well-known variant in C5orf66: [T135086514C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=254577).

<# T135086514C #>
 <Variant hgvs="NC_000005.10:g.135086514T>C" name="T135086514C"> 
     
    This variant is a change at a specific point in the C5orf66 gene from thymine (T) to cytosine (C) resulting in incorrect protien function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.

     # What does this mean?
 
     People with this variant have one copy of the [T135086514C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=254577) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

     # What is the effect of this variant?

     You are in the Mild Loss of Function category. See below for more information.

     # What does this mean?

     Your C5orf66 gene has no variants. A normal gene is referred to as a "wild-type" gene.

     # What is the effect of this variant?

     Your variant is not associated with any loss of function.

     # How common is this genotype in the general population?

 <piechart percentage=29.1 />
