# Gene symbol 
CHRNE

# Full name of gene
Acetylcholine receptor subunit epsilon

# What does the <gene_symbol> gene do?

The CHRNE gene encodes a protein found in neuromuscular junctions that opens ion-conducting channels across cell membranes. It is involved in [muscle contractions, response to nicotine, synaptic transmission, and transport](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q04844#function). Variants in CHRNE are associated with the autoimmune disorder [myasthenia gravis](https://www.omim.org/entry/254200) as well as congenital myasthenic syndrome [4a](https://www.omim.org/entry/605809), [4b](https://www.omim.org/entry/616324), and [4c](https://www.omim.org/entry/608931), which causes progressive muscle weakness. Other variants reduce natural killer cell function in the immune system and are associated with [CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524). 

This gene is located on chromosome 17. The protein it creates acts in your immune system and muscles.

# What are the effects of variants in <gene_symbol>?

For the vast majority of people, the overall risk associated with the common <gene_symbol> variants is small, and do not impact treatment. It is possible that variants in this gene interact with other gene variants, which is the reason for our inclusion of this gene in the gene panel.

# Severe Risk

Natural killer cells (NKC) are a type of white blood cells found in the blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes. They kill viral infected cells and tumorous cells. CFS patients have half the cellular efficiency of the normal population with a [17% cellular death
rate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524). The A1074G variant decreases gene expression in both the DNA and RNA, causing significant reduction in NKC activity. This variant was twice as common in [CFS patients at 62.1% with an odds ratio of 4.36.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524)

# What should I do about this?

Many dietary supplements have been found to increase or decrease natural killer cell function.

-   [Resveratrol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4855330/) stimulates the immune system in increase NKC activity, but
    sufficient body concentration can only be achieved through supplementation.
-   [Myricetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075019), a flavonoid found in food and red wine, can increase NKC activity.
-   [Quercetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19449452), a flavonoid in onions and fruits may improve NKC and T cell function.
-   [Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) including suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and valproric acid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17349632/) impair NKC function, and should be avoided.

Congenital myasthenic syndromes are a group of rare disorders that affects the proteins at the neuromuscular junctions and may cause
[abnormalities in the CHRME receptors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16156017). It causes easy tiredness, muscle weakness, [scoliosis, and repetitive-compound muscle action.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27779167) Symptoms may worsen during [pregnancy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23108489). Other variants associated with myasthenic syndrome include the [AA epsilon1267delG deletion variant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=244116), [1033-1G&gt;C: splice acceptor variant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=410057), [971delT deletion variant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=33387), and [130dupG duplication variant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=244117).

# What should I do about this?

Consult [a neurologist](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23108489) during and after pregnancy. It afflicted with slow channel syndrome, consider adding [salbutamol in addition to fluoxetine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23281026). [Galantamine](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q04844) is also used in treatment.
