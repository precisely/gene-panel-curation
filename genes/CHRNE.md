# What does the CHRNE gene do?

The CHRNE gene encodes a protein found in neuromuscular junctions that opens ion-conducting channels across cell membranes. It is involved in [muscle contractions, response to nicotine, synaptic transmission, and transport](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q04844#function). Variants in CHRNE are associated with the autoimmune disorder [myasthenia gravis](https://www.omim.org/entry/254200) as well as congenital myasthenic syndrome [4a](https://www.omim.org/entry/605809), [4b](https://www.omim.org/entry/616324), and [4c](https://www.omim.org/entry/608931), which causes progressive muscle weakness. Other variants reduce natural killer cell function in the immune system and are associated with [CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524). 

This gene is located on chromosome 17.  The protein it creates acts in your immune system and muscles.

 # What are some common mutations of CHRNE?
 
There are 2 well known variants in CHRNE: [G1074A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/128767/) and  [C865T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/18344/).

# How do changes in CHRNE affect people?

For the vast majority of people, the overall risk associated with the common CHRNE variants is small, and do not impact treatment. It is possible that variants in this gene interact with other gene variants, which is the reason for our inclusion of this gene in the gene panel.

# Severe Loss of Function

Natural killer cells (NKC) are a type of white blood cells found in the blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes. They kill viral infected cells and tumorous cells. CFS patients have half the cellular efficiency of the normal population with a [17% cellular death
rate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524). The A1074G variant decreases gene expression in both the DNA and RNA, causing significant reduction in NKC activity. This variant was twice as common in [CFS patients at 62.1% with an odds ratio of 4.36.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524)

# What should I do about this?

Many dietary supplements have been found to increase or decrease natural killer cell function.

*   [Resveratrol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4855330/) stimulates the immune system in increase NKC activity, but
    sufficient body concentration can only be achieved through supplementation.
*   [Myricetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075019), a flavonoid found in food and red wine, can increase NKC activity.
*   [Quercetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19449452), a flavonoid in onions and fruits may improve NKC and T cell function.
*   [Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) including suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and valproric acid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17349632/) impair NKC function, and should be avoided.
