# What does the CHRNE gene do?

The CHRNE gene encodes a protein found in neuromuscular junctions that opens ion-conducting channels across cell membranes. It is involved in [muscle contractions, response to nicotine, synaptic transmission, and transport](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q04844#function). Variants in CHRNE are associated with the autoimmune disorder [myasthenia gravis](https://www.omim.org/entry/254200) as well as congenital myasthenic syndrome [4a](https://www.omim.org/entry/605809), [4b](https://www.omim.org/entry/616324), and [4c](https://www.omim.org/entry/608931), which cause progressive muscle weakness. Other variants reduce natural killer cell function in the immune system and are associated with [CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524). 

This gene is located on chromosome 17. The protein it creates acts in your immune system and muscles.

# What are some common mutations of CHRNE?
 
There are two well-known variants in CHRNE: [G1074A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/128767/) and [C865T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/18344/).

<# G1074A #>
  <Variant hgvs="NC_000017.11:g.4901607G>A" name="G1074A"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the CHRNE gene from guanine (G) to adenine (A) resulting in incorrect protein function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.

# How do changes in CHRNE affect people?

For the vast majority of people, the overall risk associated with the common CHRNE variants is small and does not impact treatment. It is possible that variants in this gene interact with other gene variants, which is the reason for our inclusion of this gene.

# Severe Loss of Function

Natural killer cells (NKC) are a type of white blood cells found in the blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes. They kill viral infected cells and tumorous cells. CFS patients have half the cellular efficiency of the normal population with a [17% cellular death
rate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524). The A1074G variant decreases gene expression in both the DNA and RNA, causing significant reduction in NKC activity. This variant is twice as common in [CFS patients at 62.1% with an odds ratio of 4.36.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524)

# What should I do about this?

Many dietary supplements have been found to increase or decrease natural killer cell function.

*  [Resveratrol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4855330/) stimulates the immune system by increasing NKC activity, but
  sufficient body concentration can only be achieved through supplementation.
*  [Myricetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075019), a flavonoid found in food and red wine, can increase NKC activity.
*  [Quercetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19449452), a flavonoid in onions and fruits, may improve NKC and T cell function.
*  [Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), including suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and valproic acid,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17349632/) impair NKC function, and should be avoided.

# Severe Risk

Congenital myasthenic syndromes are a group of rare disorders that affects the proteins at the neuromuscular junctions and may cause
[abnormalities in the CHRME receptors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16156017). It causes easy tiredness, muscle weakness, [scoliosis, and repetitive-compound muscle action.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27779167) Symptoms may worsen during [pregnancy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23108489). Other variants associated with myasthenic syndrome include the [AA epsilon1267delG deletion variant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=244116), [1033-1G&gt;C: splice acceptor variant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=410057), [971delT deletion variant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=33387), and [130dupG duplication variant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=244117).

# What should I do about this?

Consult [a neurologist](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23108489) during and after pregnancy. It afflicted with slow channel syndrome, consider adding [salbutamol in addition to fluoxetine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23281026). [Galantamine](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q04844) is also used in treatment.
