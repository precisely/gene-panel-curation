# What does the TRPM3 gene do?

TRPM3 controls [calcium channels](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9HCF6#expression) that help detect temperature and pain. For ME/CFS patients, changes in the gene are linked with [insulin and glucose dysregulation](http://jme.endocrinology-journals.org/content/50/3/R75.short) like diabetes and hypoglycemia, [multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.4137/III.S25147), [problems maintaining body temperature](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/120/1/e129.short), vision problems like [cataracts and glaucoma](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-54215-2_17), and decreased function of [natural killer cells (NKC)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524), a type of white blood cell that helps the body respond to viral infections and inflammation. Other immune system issues include [releasing a type of white blood cells causing inflammation](http://jme.endocrinology-journals.org/content/50/3/R75.short). Impaired pain channels may lead to [generalized pain and nervous system ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10067-006-0433-9)problems like [inflammatory pain syndromes and rheumatoid arthritis](http://jme.endocrinology-journals.org/content/50/3/R75.short). This gene is located on chromosome 9.

This gene is located on chromosome 9.

# What are some common mutations of TRPM3?
 
A variant is a change at a specific point in the gene from the expected nucleotide sequence to another, resulting in incorrect protein function.

Your variant is [2.6X](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27835969) more common in ME/CFS patients. It causes the CHRNB4 protein to be malformed, which impacts natural killer cell (NKC) activity. Natural killer cells are a type of white blood cell found in the blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes. They kill viral infected cells and tumorous cells. Many patients with ME/CFS have NKC with lower functional ability to fight infections, and [this impairment is associated with increased illness severity](https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/about/possible-causes.html). Compared with the general population, CFS patients have NKC that are [half as effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524).

# What should I do about this?

[Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), including suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and valproic acid,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17349632/) impair NKC function and should be avoided.

Pharmaceuticals that increase natural killer cell function include:

- [Antiviral drugs such as acyclovir and ganciclovir](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353) may improve cellular function. 
- [Papillomavirus therapies, including topical agents and immunostimulants,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353) may activate NK cells.

Dietary supplements that increase natural killer cell function include:

- [Zinc](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27021581) helps to improve immune system activity and response.  
- [Resveratrol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4855330/) dietary supplements stimulate the immune system by increasing NKC function. 
- [Myricetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075019), found in food and red wine, may increase NKC activity. 
- [Quercetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19449452), found in onions and fruits, may improve NKC and T cell function. 
- [Inositol hexaphosphate (IP6), found in germ, bran, and whole kernel corn](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11366552) may activate the immune system and help fight bacterial and fungal infections.
