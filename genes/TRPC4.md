# What are some common mutations of TRPC4?
 
There are four common variants in TRPC4: [G37668344T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=1570612), [T159323005C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=2985167), [G37793875T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=655207), and [C37793812T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=6650469).

<# G37668344T #>
  <Variant hgvs="NC_000013.11:g.37668344G>T" name="G37668344T"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the TRPC4 gene from guanine (G) to thymine (T) resulting in incorrect protein function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.

# How do changes in TRPC4 affect people?

For the vast majority of people, the overall risk associated with the common TRPC4 variants is small and does not impact treatment. It is possible that variants in this gene interact with other gene variants, which is the reason for our inclusion of this gene.
