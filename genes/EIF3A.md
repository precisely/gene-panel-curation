# What are some common mutations of EIF3A?
 
There is one well-known variant in EIF3A: [A119059941G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=1523773).

<# A119059941G #>
 <Variant hgvs="NC_000010.11:g.119059941A>G" name="A119059941G"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the EIF3A gene from adenine (A) to guanine (G) resulting in incorrect protien function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.
 
</Variant>

<# A119059941G #>
 <Genotype hgvs="NC_000010.11:g.[119059941A>G];[119059941=]" name="A119059941G"> 

     # What does this mean?
 
     People with this variant have one copy of the [A119059941G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=1523773) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

     # What is the effect of this variant?

     You are in the Mild Loss of Function category. See below for more information.

     # What does this mean?

     People with this variant have two copies of the [A119059941G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=1523773) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

     # What is the effect of this variant?

     You are in the Moderate Loss of Function category. See below for more information.

     # What does this mean?

     Your EIF3A gene has no variants. A normal gene is referred to as a "wild-type" gene.

     # What is the effect of this variant?

     Your variant is not associated with any loss of function.

     # How common is this genotype in the general population?

 <piechart percentage=35.3 />
