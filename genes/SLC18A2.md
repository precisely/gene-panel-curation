# What are some common mutations of SLC18A2?
 
There are two well-known variants in SLC18A2: [C117278860T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=363236) and [C117259615T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=929493).

<# C117278860T #>
 <Variant hgvs="NC_000010.11:g.117278860C>T" name="C117278860T"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the SLC18A2 gene from cytosine (C) to thymine (T) resulting in incorrect protein function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.
 
</Variant>
<# C117259615T #>
 <Variant hgvs="NC_000010.11:g.117259615C>T" name="C117259615T"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the SLC18A2 gene from cytosine (C) to thymine (T) resulting in incorrect protein function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.
