# What are some common mutations of DRD2?
 
There are eight common variants in DRD2: [C932G (p.Ser311Cys](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/256813/), [G811-83T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/375655/), [C113282275A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=rs1124492), [113475530insA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=rs1799732), [G2137A (p.Glu713Lys)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/2105/), [C113411553A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=rs46220755), [G113460810A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=rs4648317), and [C957T (p.Pro319=)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/198436/).
