# What are some common mutations of MAOB?
 
There is one well-known variant in MAOB: [T43768752A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=1799836).

<# T43768752A #>
 <Variant hgvs="NC_000023.11:g.43768752T>A" name="T43768752A"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the MAOB gene from adenine (A) to adenine (A) resulting in incorrect protien function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.
 
</Variant>

<# T43768752A #>
 <Genotype hgvs="NC_000023.11:g.[43768752T>A];[43768752=]" name="T43768752A"> 

     # What does this mean?
 
     People with this variant have one copy of the [T43768752A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=1799836) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

     # What is the effect of this variant?

     Your variant is not associated with any loss of function.

     # How common is this genotype in the general population?

 <piechart percentage=49.4 />

     # What does this mean?

     People with this variant have two copies of the [T43768752A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=1799836) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

     # What is the effect of this variant?

     You are in the Moderate Loss of Function category. See below for more information.

     # What does this mean?

     Your MAOB gene has no variants. A normal gene is referred to as a "wild-type" gene.

     # What is the effect of this variant?

     Your variant is not associated with any loss of function.

     # How common is this genotype in the general population?
