# What does the TPRM8 gene do?

The TRPM8 gene encodes a cation channel that allows the movement of sodium, potassium, calcium, and cesium across plasma barriers activated by [low temperatures](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14757700?dopt=Abstract).  It allows the body to detect [temperature
changes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17217067), respond to cold, balance calcium in the body, and feel the cooling effects of menthol.   Variants in TRPM8 are associated with [breast](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20482834), [pancreatic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27038374), [lung](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24037916), and [prostate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25065497) cancer.  Additional issues include increased susceptibility to [metabolic syndrome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25967713), [migraines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23294458?dopt=Abstract), [alcohol dependence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23942779?dopt=Abstract), [COPD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27789940), [pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22072275?dopt=Abstract) and [cold sensitivity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21542321?dopt=Abstract), [asthma](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26272603), and [inflammation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26660531).  Other variants reduce natural killer cell function in the immune system and are associated with [CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524).

This gene is located on chromosome 2.  The cation channel it creates acts in your nervous, immune, and sensory systems

# What should I do about this?

No therapies are medically indicated at the moment.

<# G750C (G;C) #>

# Moderate Risk

The heterozygous GC variant has multiple effects.  Firstly, it causes [increased sensitivity to cold](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21542321?dopt=Abstract) as well as increased [inflammation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26660531) due to improper temperature regulation.  It may also cause increased cold-induced airway hyperresponsiveness (CAH) in bronchial asthma (BA) patients.  As the TRPM8 gene regulates cold perception, improper function may lead to hyperstimulation and increased CAH events.  The GC genotype has an [odds ratio of 3.73](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26272603), a decrease in forced expiratory volume.

# What should I do about this?

If possible, avoid cold air [below 25˚ C](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q7Z2W7). The carboxamide [WS-12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18930858)(a menthol derivative with much higher efficacy and potency) or [icilin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17517434) may protect against increased cold perception by upregulating the TRPM8 gene,
reducing bronchial shock.  Other medications include [menthol and eucalyptol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14757700), but this variant causes [lower menthol efficacy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21542321?dopt=Abstract). Users should avoid alcohol and smoking.

<# G750C (C;C) #>

# Severe Risk

The homozygous GG variant has greatly decreased gene function, causing greatly [increased sensitivity to cold](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21542321?dopt=Abstract) and greatly increased [inflammation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26660531).  This may cause increased [asthmatic attacks](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26272603) in cold weather and decreased lung function.

# What should I do about this?

Avoid cold air [below 25˚ C](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q7Z2W7). The carboxamide [WS-12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18930858)(a menthol derivative with much higher efficacy and potency) or [icilin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17517434) may protect against increased cold perception by upregulating the TRPM8 gene,

This variant increases the risk for migraines as compared to CC or CT.

# What should I do about this?

Many compounds may decrease pain due to TRMP8 variants.

- [WS-12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18930858)(a menthol derivative) has much higher potency and is twice as efficient as menthol as therapy for chronic neuropathic pain
- Cannabinoid receptors [CB1 and CB2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18511441) are associated with pain modulation, but smoking should be avoided to reduce COPD and lung cancer risk.
- [Nerve growth factor](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18511441) administered topically decreases thermal and mechanical pain

Other therapies may include [antibodies, siRNA, gene therapy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18511441), and avoiding air [below 25˚ C](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q7Z2W7).

<# G3264+2567A (G;A) G3264+630A (G;A) #>

# Severe Risk

Natural killer cells (NKC) are a type of white blood cells found in the blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes.  They kill viral infected cells and tumorous cells.  CFS patients have half the cellular efficiency of the normal population with a [17% cellular death rate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524).  The G3264+2567A variant decreases gene expression in both the DNA and RNA, causing significant reduction in NKC activity.  This variant was 2X as common in [CFS patients at 73.3% with an odds ratio of 3.56](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524).  The G3264+630A variant decreases gene expression in both the DNA and RNA, causing significant reduction in NKC activity.  This variant was 2X as common in [CFS patients at 82.1% with an odds ratio of 7.19.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524)

# What should I do about this?

Many dietary supplements have been found to increase or decrease natural killer cell function. 

- [Resveratrol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4855330/) stimulates the immune system in increase NKC activity, but sufficient body concentration can only be achieved through supplementation.  
- [Myricetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075019), a flavonoid found in food and red wine, can increase NKC activity.
- [Quercetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19449452), a flavonoid in onions and fruits may improve NKC and T cell function.
- [Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) including suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and valproic acid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17349632/) impair NKC function and should be avoided.

# What should I do about this?

Some general therapies are associated with TPRM8 variants.  Avoid cold air [below 25˚ C](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q7Z2W7). The carboxamide [WS-12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18930858)(a menthol derivative with much higher efficacy and potency) or [icilin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17517434) may protect against increased cold perception by upregulating the TRPM8 gene.  Other medications include [menthol and eucalyptol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14757700).
