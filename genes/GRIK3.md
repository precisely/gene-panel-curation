# What does the GRIK3 gene do?

The GRIK3 gene creates a protein that helps form receptors for the transmitter [glutamate.](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/educational-resources/brain-basics/brain-basics.shtml) Problems creating or absorbing glutamate are linked to [schizophrenia, depression, and memory problems.](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/educational-resources/brain-basics/brain-basics.shtml) Sustained exposure to excess glutamate in CFS patients causes sickness, neurotoxicity, stress, and peripheral nervous sensitivity. Currently, GRIK3 variants are linked to recurrent [major](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16958029) [depressive disorder](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19221446/), [developmental delays](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24449200/), and a [30% increase](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25054019?dopt=Abstract) in the [risk](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11986986) for [schizophrenia.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19921975/)

This gene is located on chromosome 1. The protein it creates acts in your brain and nervous system.

# How do changes in GRIK3 affect people?

The variants in GRIK3 have strong associations with increased risk of schizophrenia, but for most patients this may not change treatment for CFS. However, the associations with glutamate and other neurological issues may interact with other genes, so we have included it in this disease panel.

| Variant       |Population %           | 
| :-------------: |:-------------:|
| A7783504C (A;C) | 15.8% |
| C36983994T (C;T) | 1.8%     |

[This gene creates a protein that helps form receptors for glutamate that act as excitatory neurotransmitters in your brain and nervous system.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=2899) Excitatory transmitters increase the chance that the neuron will fire, [enhancing electrical flow among brain cells.](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/educational-resources/brain-basics/brain-basics.shtml) Glutamate is the most important transmitter for normal brain function, but [elevated levels are toxic to neurons.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10807/) 

GRIK3 Ser310Ala polymorphism has been linked to [schizophrenia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19921975/) and [major depression.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16958029) The Ser310Ala allele in homozygosity is associated with higher scores in [harm avoidance, anticipatory worry, and shyness, with lower scores in exploratory excitability, responsibility, resourcefulness, helpfulness, compassion, self-directedness, and cooperativeness.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19221446/) This pattern of scores is akin to that observed in [depressed patients.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19221446/) GRIK3 rs6691840 polymorphism was found to increase the risk of [schizophrenia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19921975/) by [30%.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25054019?dopt=Abstract) Microdeletions have also been indicated in [severe developmental delays.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24449200/)

Two genotypes of GRIK3 are associated with CFS, the heterozygous A:C [A7783504C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26859813) and the heterozygous C:T [C36983994T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27835969). A:C A7783504C was found in 71.4% of CFS patients, compared with 2.6% of healthy patients. C:T C36983994T was found in 90.5% of CFS patients, compared with 21.1% of healthy patients.

# What should I do about this?

CFS is linked to improper Glutamate:GABA balance, as well as exposure to extracellular glutamate caused by neuroinflammatory stimuli. Sustained exposure to extracellular glutamate in CFS patients causes [sickness behavior, neurotoxicity, stress, and peripheral nervous sensitivity.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5314655/)

Helpful dietary supplements may include: [Omega-3 PUFAs, CoQ10, N-acetylcysteine, vitamin B12, curcumin, zinc, magnesium, L-Taurine, and L-carnitine.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5314655/)
