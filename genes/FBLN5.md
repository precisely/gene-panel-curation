# What are some common mutations of FBLN5?
 
There are two well-known variants in FBLN5: [A84743518T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=17120254) and [C91917655A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=2249954).

<# A84743518T #>
 <Variant hgvs="CM000676.2:g.84743518A>T" name="A84743518T"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the FBLN5 gene from adenine (A) to thymine (T) resulting in incorrect protein function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.
 
</Variant>
<# C91917655A  #>
 <Variant hgvs="NC_000014.9:g.91917655C>A" name="C91917655A"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the FBLN5 gene from cytosine (C) to adenine (A) resulting in incorrect protein function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.

     # What does this mean?
 
     People with this variant have one copy of the [A84743518T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=17120254) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

     # What is the effect of this variant?

     This variant is not associated with increased risk.
