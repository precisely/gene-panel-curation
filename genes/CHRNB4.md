# What does the CHRNB4 gene do?

The CHRNB4 ([neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit beta-4](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P30926)) gene creates a protein that is part of a beta subunit of a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). It operates a [cation channel](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1143) that nicotine binds to, muscle contraction, and synaptic transmission. Variants in CHRNA5 have been linked to an increased risk of [lung cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18385738?dopt=Abstract) and [nicotine dependence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19443489). Other variants are associated with [ME/CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524) due to natural killer cell (NKC) disfunction.

This gene is located on chromosome 15. The protein it creates acts in the adrenal glands and male testis.

# How do changes in CHRNB4 affect people?

For the vast majority of people, the overall risk associated with the common CHRNB4 variants is small and does not impact treatment. It is possible that variants in this gene interact with other gene variants, which is the reason for our inclusion of this gene.

# Moderate Risk

Natural killer cells (NKC) are a type of white blood cells found in the blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes. They kill viral infected cells and tumorous cells. Many patients with ME/CFS have NK cells with lower functional ability to fight infections, and [this impairment is associated with illness severity](https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/about/possible-causes.html). Compared with the general population, CFS patients have half the cellular efficiency with a [17% cellular death rate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524).

The following variants decrease gene expression in both the DNA and RNA, causing significant reduction in NKC activity.

- [A70699095G (A;G)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524) is [2.5X] more common in CFS patients. 
- [T70795494C (T;T)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524) is [1.2X] more common in CFS patients.

# What should I do about this?

Some pharmaceuticals may increase or decrease natural killer cell function:

- [Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), including suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and valproic acid,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17349632/) impair NKC function and should be avoided. 
- [Acyclovir, ganciclovir, and related prophylactic antiviral drugs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353) may improve cellular function. 
- [Therapies for papillomaviruses, topical agents, physical approaches, and immunostimulants,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353) may activate NK cells. 
- [Cytokine therapies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353), such as [IFN-Î±](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/bio-therapies-fact-sheet) in CNKD1, may induce higher levels of NKC cytotoxic activity by [activating white blood cells](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/bio-therapies-fact-sheet). 

Many dietary supplements have been found to increase natural killer cell function:

- [Resveratrol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4855330/) stimulates the immune system by increasing NKC activity, but sufficient body concentration can only be achieved through supplementation. 
- [Myricetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075019), a flavonoid found in food and red wine, can increase NKC activity. 
- [Quercetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19449452), a flavonoid in onions and fruits, may improve NKC and T cell function. 
- [Bulgarian yogurt fermented with L. delbrueckii ssp. Bulgaricus augments NKC activity.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26686726) 
- [Zinc](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27021581) helps to improve immune system activity and response. 
- [Inositol hexaphosphate (IP6), found in germ, bran, and whole kernel corn](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11366552) may activate the immune system and help fight bacterial and fungal infections. 
- [Arabinoxylan rice bran (MGN-3/Biobran](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25541298) increases activation and stimulates cell killing activity.

# Moderate Risk

CHRN genes pay a large role in the risk for nicotine dependence, smoking, and lung cancer. This CHRNB4 variant is associated with a [higher risk of habitual smoking in Caucasians](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18519524?dopt=Abstract), with an [odds ratio of 1.45](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19259974?dopt=Abstract) for a risk of heavy smoking and an increased [odds ratio of 1.33](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19259974?dopt=Abstract) for [nicotine dependence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19443489?dopt=Abstract). There is also an increased susceptibility to [lung cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18385738?dopt=Abstract).

# What should I do about this?

People should not smoke. If you do smoke, be aware of your risk for dependency. Consider regular checks for lung cancer.

[Many factors may decrease your risk of lung cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/types/lung/patient/lung-prevention-pdq#section/all):

- Avoid cigarettes, cigars, pipe smoking, and secondhand smoke. 
- Have less than one alcoholic drink per day. 
- Practice safe sex, and avoid HIV infection. 
- Avoid radiation exposure, including atomic bomb radiation, radiation therapy, imaging tests, and radon. 
- Avoid environmental toxins, such as asbestos, arsenic, chromium, nickel, beryllium, cadmium, tar, soot, and air pollution. 
- [Beta carotene supplements, made from yellow and orange fruits and vegetables and dark green, leafy vegetables,](https://www.cancer.gov/types/lung/patient/lung-prevention-pdq#section/all) may help reduce risk for heavy smokers. 

[Medications](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P30926) used for treating CHRNB4 issues include [Dextromethorphan](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00514), [Ethanol](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00898), [Galantamine](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00674), [Levomethadyl acetate](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01227), [Nicotine](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00184), and [Pentolinium](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01090).

# High Risk

This homozygous CHRNB4 variant is associated with a [much higher risk of habitual smoking in Caucasians](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18519524?dopt=Abstract). The risk of heavy smoking has an [odds ratio of 1.64](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19259974?dopt=Abstract), and the risk for [nicotine dependence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19443489?dopt=Abstract) has [odds ratio of 1.33](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19259974?dopt=Abstract). There is also an greatly increased susceptibility to [lung cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18385738?dopt=Abstract), with an odds ratio of 1.28.
