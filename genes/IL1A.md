# What are some common mutations of IL1A?
 
There is one well-known variant in IL1A: [G112777818T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=2071376).

<# G112777818T #>
 <Variant hgvs="NC_000002.12:g.112777818G>T" name="G112777818T"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the IL1A gene from guanine (G) to thymine (T) resulting in incorrect protien function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.
 
</Variant>

<# G112777818T #>
 <Genotype hgvs="NC_000002.12:g.[112777818G>T];[112777818=]" name="G112777818T"> 

     # What does this mean?
 
     People with this variant have one copy of the [G112777818T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=2071376) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

     # What is the effect of this variant?

     You are in the Mild Loss of Function category. See below for more information.

     # What does this mean?

     People with this variant have two copies of the [G112777818T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=2071376) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

     # What is the effect of this variant?

     You are in the Moderate Loss of Function category. See below for more information.

     # What does this mean?

     Your IL1A gene has no variants. A normal gene is referred to as a "wild-type" gene.

     # What is the effect of this variant?

     Your variant is not associated with any loss of function.

     # How common is this genotype in the general population?

 <piechart percentage=26.7 />
