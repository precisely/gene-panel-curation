# Gene symbol 

SLC6A4

# Full name of gene

Sodium-dependent serotonin transporter

# What does the <gene_symbol> gene do?
The SLC6A4 gene creates the Sodium-dependent serotonin transporter protein.  The protein transports serotonin to be recycled and is targeted by many antidepressants in the SSRI and Tricyclic classes.  Variants in this gene can cause 5%-95% loss of serotonin uptake activity, and may cause [alcoholism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22355291?dopt=Abstract) and [increased susceptibility to CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14592408) as well as many [mood disorders](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12130784) including [obsessive compulsive disorder,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16642437) [depression,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26979101) and [bipolar disorder.](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P31645#pathology_and_biotech)
 
This gene is located on chromosome 17. The protein it creates acts in your brain and nervous system.

# What are some common mutations of <gene_symbol>?

There are 3 well known variants in this gene: <variant list?>

<A3609G variant view with A to G transformation>

This variant is a change at a specific point in the <gene_symbol> gene from adenine (A) to guanine (G), resulting in reduced enzyme activity. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.

<T463G variant view with T to G transformation>

This variant is a change at a specific point in the <gene_symbol> gene from thymine (T) to guanine (G), resulting in reduced protein creation.  This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a mis-sense mutation.

< 5-HTTLPR add in VNTR>

This variant changes the number of repeated sections in the gene.  It is called a variable number tandem repeats variant (VNTR).

# What are the effects of variants in <gene_symbol>?

For the vast majority of people, the overall risk associated with the common <gene_symbol> variants is small, and do not impact treatment. It is possible that variants in this gene interact with other gene variants, which is the reason for our inclusion of this gene in the gene panel.

# Seratonin Deficit

The LL variant causes a serotonin deficit in the body, and it is linked to increasing the risk of [obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) 1.8X.]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16642437)  However, this variant also causes improved response to [SSRI medication.]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12476327)    It has been linked to CFS due to [concentrated extracellular serotonin and higher susceptibility to CFS.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14592408) The serotonin deficit also increases brain disfunction in CFS patients, as they are less tolerant to sustained [mental workload causing increased central fatigue]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19704949).  Ecstasy also greatly worsens [verbal memory](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26231032) for this variant.

# What should I do about this?

Users should not use ecstasy but should consider the use of SSRI.  Users should monitor their mental and physical energy level closely to prevent post-exertional malaise.

Drugs currently used for SLC6A4 problems include [antidepressants, dopamine, doxepin, tramadol, flueoxetine, and many more.](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P31645#pathology_and_biotech)

<variant and population data>
  
# Balanced Seratonin

This variant has one short and one long copy of this gene.  The gene has diminished function, with reduced serotonin expression and function and increased [fear and anxiety-related behaviors]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12130784) as well as [higher neuroticism scores and lower extraversion and openness.]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18486105?dopt=Abstract).  These symptoms are also consistent with the increased risk for [major depressive disorders.]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26979101)  However, this variant has an [2.37 Odds ratio]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17414739) for adverse reactions to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.  Additional issues include increased risk for [alcoholism]( http://www.omim.org/entry/103780) and [reduced physical activity and disability in CFS patients.]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26473596)

# What should I do about this?

Users should not drink.  However, research indicates [parents can influence the likelihood of offspring developing problematic alcohol-related behaviors.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28262188)  Additionally, patients should carefully monitor SSRI drugs for side effects.

Drugs currently used for SLC6A4 problems include [antidepressants, dopamine, doxepin, tramadol, and many more.]( http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P31645#pathology_and_biotech)

# Seratonin Excess

This variant has two short copies.  It has severely diminished function (5-95%), with reduced serotonin expression and function and increased [fear and anxiety-related behaviors]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12130784) as well as [higher neuroticism scores and lower extraversion and openness.]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18486105?dopt=Abstract).  These symptoms are also consistent with the increased risk for [major depressive disorders.]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26979101)  However, this variant has an [1.17 Odds ratio]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17414739) for adverse reactions to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.  Male [citalopram]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28608626) users have an increased risk of committing suicide.  Additional issues include increased risk for [alcoholism]( http://www.omim.org/entry/103780).  CFS patients have [reduced physical activity and increased disability]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26473596) as well as increased mental disfuction as they are less tolerant to sustained [mental workload causing increased central fatigue]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19704949)

# What should I do about this?

Patients should closely monitor their mental and physical energy output to prevent post-exertional malaise.  Users should consider not using SSRI medications or citalopram to reduce the chance of side effects or suicide.  Users should not drink.  However, research indicates [parents can influence the likelihood of offspring developing problematic alcohol-related behaviors.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28262188)

Drugs currently used for SLC6A4 problems include [antidepressants, dopamine, doxepin, tramadol, and many more.]( http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P31645#pathology_and_biotech)


T463G (T;T)

<variant and population data>
  
# Impaired Function

The T allele causes lower mRNA and protein levels and therefore reduced serotonin.  Individuals with this variant have higher drinking intensity and higher urge and crave for drinking, and thus increased risk of [alcohol dependence.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22355291?dopt=Abstract)

# What should I do about this?

Users should not drink.  However, research indicates [parents can influence the likelihood of offspring developing problematic alcohol-related behaviors.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28262188)
