# What does the SLCA4 gene do?

The SLC6A4 gene creates a protein targeted by many SSRI antidepressants that transports serotonin to be recycled. Variants in this gene cause 5%-95% loss of function for the protein, causing brain fog, anxiety, and post-exertional malaise. It is linked to [alcoholism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22355291?dopt=Abstract), [increased susceptibility to CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14592408), and [mood disorders](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12130784) like [OCD,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16642437) [depression,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26979101) and [bipolar disorder.](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P31645#pathology_and_biotech)

This gene is located on chromosome 17.  The protein it creates acts in your brain and nervous system.

# How do changes in SLCA4 affect people?

For the vast majority of people, the overall risk associated with the common SLCA4 variants is small, and do not impact treatment. It is possible that variants in this gene interact with other gene variants, which is the reason for our inclusion of this gene in the gene panel.

<# 5-HTTLPR (L;L) G3609A (G;G) #>

# Serotonin Deficit

The LL variant causes a serotonin deficit in the body, and it is linked to increasing the risk of [obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) 1.8X](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16642437) and greatly worsened [verbal memory](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26231032) when consuming substances like MDMA (ecstasy).  However, this variant also causes improved response to [SSRI medication.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12476327)

It has been linked to CFS as [concentrated extracellular serotonin may cause higher susceptibility to CFS.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14592408) The serotonin deficit also increases brain dysfunction, as CFS patients are less tolerant to sustained [mental workload, which causes increased central fatigue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19704949).

# What should I do about this?

Do not use MDMA (ecstasy). Consult with your doctor about SSRIs. Monitor your mental and physical energy level closely to prevent post-exertional malaise (PEM).

Drugs currently used for SLC6A4 problems include [antidepressants, dopamine, doxepin, tramadol, fluoxetine, and many more.](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P31645#pathology_and_biotech)

<# 5-HTTLPR (S;L) G3609A (A;G) #>

# Balanced Serotonin

This variant has one short and one long copy of this gene. The gene has diminished function and increased serotonin levels, causing [fear and anxiety-related behaviors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12130784) as well as [higher neuroticism scores and lower extraversion and openness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18486105?dopt=Abstract) and increased risk for [depression.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26979101)  However, this variant has [2.37 odds](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17414739) for adverse reactions to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Additional issues include increased risk for [alcoholism](http://www.omim.org/entry/103780), [reduced physical activity, and increased disability in CFS patients.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26473596)

# What should I do about this?

People with this variant should avoid alcohol use. However, research indicates [parents can influence the likelihood of offspring developing problematic alcohol-related behaviors.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28262188) Additionally, people should carefully monitor SSRI drugs for side effects.

<# 5-HTTLPR (S;S) G3609A (A;A) #>

# Serotonin Excess

Two short copies causes severely diminished protein function (5-95%), and increased serotonin levels. Symptoms include increased fatigue, [fear, anxiety](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12130784), and [neuroticism with lower extraversion and openness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18486105?dopt=Abstract), consistent with increased risk for [major depressive disorders.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26979101) However, this variant has [1.17 increased odds](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17414739) for adverse reactions to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and increased suicide risk for male [citalopram](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28608626). Additional issues include increased risk for [alcoholism](http://www.omim.org/entry/103780).

CFS patients have [reduced physical activity and increased disability](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26473596) as well as increased mental dysfunction due to sustained [mental workload causing increased central fatigue.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19704949)

# What should I do about this?

Closely monitor mental and physical energy output to prevent post-exertional malaise (PEM). Consider not using SSRI medications or citalopram to reduce the chance of side effects or suicide. Avoid alcohol.

<# T463G (T;T) #>

# Severe Risk

The T allele causes lower protein levels and reduced serotonin. Individuals with this variant have higher drinking intensity and higher urge and crave for drinking, leading to an increased risk of [alcohol dependence.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22355291?dopt=Abstract)

# What should I do about this?

Avoid alcohol. Early intervention by parents can also reduce the risk of [developing problematic alcohol-related behaviors.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28262188)

<# C30204775T (T;T) #>

# Severe Risk

This variant causes an increased likelihood of [mood disorders](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19381154) such as [depression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20981038).  The efficacy of SSRI or SNRI drugs is also [affected](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26674707).

# What should I do about this?

Users should carefully monitor mood and look for signs of mood disorders or oppression.  If taking SSRIs or SNRIs, consult with your physician to see if this variant is affecting their efficacy.  Drugs currently used for SLC6A4 problems include [antidepressants, dopamine, doxepin, tramadol, and many more.](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P31645#pathology_and_biotech)

<# C30219896T (T;T) #>

# Severe Risk

Women with this variant have an odd ratio of 1.72 of  having a child with [facial clefts](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22072571).  It may cause increased energy, as it is associated with a [64% lower odds of lower energy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27720787).

# Gene symbol 

SLC6A4

# Full name of gene

Sodium-dependent serotonin transporter

# What does the <gene_symbol> gene do?
The SLC6A4 gene creates a protein targeted by many SSRI antidepressants that transports serotonin to be recycled. Variants in this gene cause 5%-95% loss of function for the protein, causing brain fog, anxiety, and post-exertional malaise. It is linked to [alcoholism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22355291?dopt=Abstract), [increased susceptibility to CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14592408), and [mood disorders](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12130784) like [OCD,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16642437) [depression,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26979101) and [bipolar disorder.](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P31645#pathology_and_biotech)

This gene is located on chromosome 17. The protein it creates acts in your brain and nervous system.

<variant and population data>

# Serotonin Deficit

The LL variant causes a serotonin deficit in the body, and it is linked to increasing the risk of [obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) 1.8X](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16642437) and greatly worsened [verbal memory](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26231032) when consuming substances like MDMA (ecstasy).  However, this variant also causes improved response to [SSRI medication.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12476327)

It has been linked to CFS as [concentrated extracellular serotonin may cause higher susceptibility to CFS.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14592408) The serotonin deficit also increases brain dysfunction, as CFS patients are less tolerant to sustained [mental workload, which causes increased central fatigue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19704949).

# What should I do about this?

Do not use MDMA (ecstasy). Consult with your doctor about SSRIs. Monitor your mental and physical energy level closely to prevent post-exertional malaise (PEM).

Drugs currently used for SLC6A4 problems include [antidepressants, dopamine, doxepin, tramadol, fluoxetine, and many more.](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P31645#pathology_and_biotech)

<variant and population data>

# Balanced Serotonin

This variant has one short and one long copy of this gene. The gene has diminished function and increased serotonin levels, causing [fear and anxiety-related behaviors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12130784) as well as [higher neuroticism scores and lower extraversion and openness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18486105?dopt=Abstract) and increased risk for [depression.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26979101)  However, this variant has [2.37 odds](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17414739) for adverse reactions to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Additional issues include increased risk for [alcoholism](http://www.omim.org/entry/103780), [reduced physical activity, and increased disability in CFS patients.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26473596)

# What should I do about this?

People with this variant should avoid alcohol use. However, research indicates [parents can influence the likelihood of offspring developing problematic alcohol-related behaviors.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28262188) Additionally, people should carefully monitor SSRI drugs for side effects.

# Serotonin Excess

Two short copies causes severely diminished protein function (5-95%), and increased serotonin levels. Symptoms include increased fatigue, [fear, anxiety](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12130784), and [neuroticism with lower extraversion and openness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18486105?dopt=Abstract), consistent with increased risk for [major depressive disorders.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26979101) However, this variant has [1.17 increased odds](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17414739) for adverse reactions to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and increased suicide risk for male [citalopram](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28608626). Additional issues include increased risk for [alcoholism](http://www.omim.org/entry/103780).

CFS patients have [reduced physical activity and increased disability](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26473596) as well as increased mental dysfunction due to sustained [mental workload causing increased central fatigue.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19704949)

# What should I do about this?

Closely monitor mental and physical energy output to prevent post-exertional malaise (PEM). Consider not using SSRI medications or citalopram to reduce the chance of side effects or suicide. Avoid alcohol. 

Drugs currently used for SLC6A4 problems include [antidepressants, dopamine, doxepin, tramadol, and many more.](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P31645#pathology_and_biotech)
  
T463G (T;T)

<variant and population data>

# Impaired Function

The T allele causes lower protein levels and reduced serotonin. Individuals with this variant have higher drinking intensity and higher urge and crave for drinking, leading to an increased risk of [alcohol dependence.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22355291?dopt=Abstract)

# What should I do about this?

Avoid alcohol. Early intervention by parents can also reduce the risk of [developing problematic alcohol-related behaviors.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28262188)
