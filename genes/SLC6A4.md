# Gene symbol 

SLC6A4

# Full name of gene

Sodium-dependent serotonin transporter

# What does the <gene_symbol> gene do?
The SLC6A4 gene creates a protein targeted by many SSRI antidepressants that transports serotonin to be recycled. Variants in this gene cause 5%-95% loss of function for the protein, causing brain fog, anxiety, and post-exertional malaise. It is linked to [alcoholism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22355291?dopt=Abstract), [increased susceptibility to CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14592408), and [mood disorders](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12130784) like [OCD,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16642437)[depression,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26979101) and [bipolar disorder.](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P31645#pathology_and_biotech)

This gene is located on chromosome 17. The protein it creates acts in your brain and nervous system.

# What are some common mutations of <gene_symbol>?

There are three well known variants in this gene: <variant list?>

<A3609G variant view with A to G transformation>

This variant is a change at a specific point in the <gene_symbol> gene from adenine (A) to guanine (G), resulting in reduced enzyme activity. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.

<T463G variant view with T to G transformation>

This variant is a change at a specific point in the <gene_symbol> gene from thymine (T) to guanine (G), resulting in reduced protein creation.  This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

< 5-HTTLPR add in VNTR>

This variant changes the number of repeated sections in the gene.  It is called a variable number tandem repeats variant (VNTR).

# What are the effects of variants in <gene_symbol>?

For the vast majority of people, the overall risk associated with the common <gene_symbol> variants is small, and do not impact treatment. It is possible that variants in this gene interact with other gene variants, which is the reason for our inclusion of this gene in the gene panel.

# Serotonin Deficit

The LL variant causes a serotonin deficit in the body, and it is linked to increasing the risk of [obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) 1.8X](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16642437) and greatly worsened [verbal memory](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26231032) when consuming substances like MDMA (ecstasy).  However, this variant also causes improved response to [SSRI medication.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12476327)

It has been linked to CFS as [concentrated extracellular serotonin may cause higher susceptibility to CFS.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14592408) The serotonin deficit also increases brain dysfunction, as CFS patients are less tolerant to sustained [mental workload, which causes increased central fatigue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19704949).

# What should I do about this?

Do not use MDMA (ecstasy). Consult with your doctor about SSRIs. Monitor your mental and physical energy level closely to prevent post-exertional malaise (PEM).

Drugs currently used for SLC6A4 problems include [antidepressants, dopamine, doxepin, tramadol, fluoxetine, and many more.](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P31645#pathology_and_biotech)

# Balanced Serotonin

This variant has one short and one long copy of this gene. The gene has diminished function and increased serotonin levels, causing [fear and anxiety-related behaviors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12130784) as well as [higher neuroticism scores and lower extraversion and openness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18486105?dopt=Abstract) and increased risk for [depression.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26979101)  However, this variant has [2.37 odds](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17414739) for adverse reactions to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Additional issues include increased risk for [alcoholism](http://www.omim.org/entry/103780), [reduced physical activity, and increased disability in CFS patients.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26473596)

# What should I do about this?

People with this variant should avoid alcohol use. However, research indicates [parents can influence the likelihood of offspring developing problematic alcohol-related behaviors.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28262188) Additionally, people should carefully monitor SSRI drugs for side effects.

# Serotonin Excess

Two short copies causes severely diminished protein function (5-95%), and increased serotonin levels. Symptoms include increased fatigue, [fear, anxiety](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12130784), and [neuroticism with lower extraversion and openness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18486105?dopt=Abstract), consistent with increased risk for [major depressive disorders.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26979101) However, this variant has [1.17 increased odds](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17414739) for adverse reactions to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and increased suicide risk for male [citalopram](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28608626). Additional issues include increased risk for [alcoholism](http://www.omim.org/entry/103780).

CFS patients have [reduced physical activity and increased disability](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26473596) as well as increased mental dysfunction due to sustained [mental workload causing increased central fatigue.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19704949)

# What should I do about this?

Closely monitor mental and physical energy output to prevent post-exertional malaise (PEM). Consider not using SSRI medications or citalopram to reduce the chance of side effects or suicide. Avoid alcohol. 

Drugs currently used for SLC6A4 problems include [antidepressants, dopamine, doxepin, tramadol, and many more.](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P31645#pathology_and_biotech)
  
T463G (T;T)

<variant and population data>

# Impaired Function

The T allele causes lower protein levels and reduced serotonin. Individuals with this variant have higher drinking intensity and higher urge and crave for drinking, leading to an increased risk of [alcohol dependence.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22355291?dopt=Abstract)

# What should I do about this?

Avoid alcohol. Early intervention by parents can also reduce the risk of [developing problematic alcohol-related behaviors.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28262188)
