# What are some common mutations of TH?
 
There are two well-known variants in TH: [A216510G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=2070762) and [C645T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=4074905).

<# A216510G #>
 <Variant hgvs="NC_000011.10:g.2165105A>G" name="A216510G"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the TH gene from adenine (A) to guanine (G) resulting in incorrect  function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.
 
</Variant>
<# A2167955G  #>
 <Variant hgvs="NC_000011.10:g.2167955G>A" name="C645T "> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the TH gene from guanine (G) to adenine (A) resulting in incorrect  function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.

     # What does this mean?
 
     People with this variant have one copy of the [A216510G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=2070762) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.
