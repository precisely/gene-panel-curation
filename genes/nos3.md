# What are some common mutations of NOS3?
 
"There are five common variants in NOS3: [A150998920G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=1007311
), [C151010400T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=2741343), [A2984+15G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/403250/), [-51-762C=](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/14016/), and [T894G (p.Asp298Glu)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/14015/)."

# How do changes in NOS3 affect people?

For the vast majority of people, the overall risk associated with the common NOS3 variants is small and does not impact treatment. It is possible that variants in this gene interact with other gene variants, which is the reason for our inclusion of this gene.
