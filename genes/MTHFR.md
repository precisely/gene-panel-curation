# What does the <gene_symbol> gene do?

<gene_symbol> is important for its role in processing the vitamin folate
(also known as B9). Folate is a precursor to the amino acid
methionine. The body uses methionine to make proteins and other
important compounds, including neurotransmitters such as serotonin,
dopamine, and norepinephrine.

# What are the effects of variants in <gene_symbol>?

For the vast majority of people, the overall risk associated with the
common <gene_symbol> variants is small, and do not impact
treatment. It is possible that variants in this gene interact with
other gene variants, which is the reason for our inclusion of this
gene in the gene panel.
