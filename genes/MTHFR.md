# What does the <gene_symbol> gene do?

<gene_symbol> is important for its role in processing the vitamin folate
(also known as B9). Folate is a precursor to the amino acid
methionine. The body uses methionine to make proteins and other
important compounds, including neurotransmitters such as serotonin,
dopamine, and norepinephrine.

This gene is located on chormosone 1, and the enzyme it produces is found in your endocrine system and pancreas.

# What are some common mutations of <gene_symbol>?

There are 2 well known mutations in this gene: <variant list?>

<gene_expression_location location="D004703; D010179; D012867">

<C677T variant view with c to T transformation>

This mutation is a change at a specific point in the <gene_symbol> gene from cytosine (C) to thymine (T), resulting in reduced enzymatic activity.  This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a mis-sense mutation.

<A1298C variant view with a to c transformation>

This mutation is a change at a specific point in the <gene_symbol> gene from adenine (A) to cytosine (C), resulting in reduced enzymatic activity.  This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a mis-sense mutation.

# What are the effects of variants in <gene_symbol>?

For the vast majority of people, the overall risk associated with the
common <gene_symbol> variants is small, and do not impact
treatment. It is possible that variants in this gene interact with
other gene variants, which is the reason for our inclusion of this
gene in the gene panel.

# Introduction

This mutation is a change at a specific point in the MTHFR gene from
adenine (A) to cytosine (T), resulting in reduced enzymatic
activity. This subsitution of a single nucleotide is known as a
missense mutation.

<function meter level="mild">
  
<efficiency  level = "82%" >
  
<variant and population data>
  
# Mild loss of function

People with the following variants have a slightly reduced effiency of processing folate (82% of normal).

# What should I do about this?

Some people with mild loss of function variant may benefit from supplementing their diets with folate. Consult your physician. 

<function meter level="moderate">
  
<efficiency  level = "35%" >
  
<variant and population data>
  
# Moderate loss of function

People with the following variants have a reduced effiency of processing folate (30% of normal).

# What should I do about this?

Most people with moderate loss of function variant may benefit from supplementing their diets with folate. Consult your physician. 

<function meter level="severe">
  
<efficiency  level = "15%" >
  
<variant and population data>
  
# Severe Loss of Function

People with the following mutations have a drastically reduced
efficiency of processing folate (15% of normal), as well as 
elevated levels of homocysteine levels have been associated with low
thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism), chronic conditions like obesity,
diabetes, high cholesterol, physical inactivity, and high blood
pressure. However, very high homocysteine levels rarely result from
having the common variants alone.

# What should I do about this?

It is strongly recommended that people in this group take folate
supplement on a daily basis. You should also be carefully evaluated
for other factors known to affect homocysteine, such as:

* eye lens dislocations
* unusual (Marfan type) body shape
* stroke
* blood clotting abnormalities
* Low thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism)
