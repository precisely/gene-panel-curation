# What does the MTHFR gene do?

MTHFR is involved in the production of folate (also known as B9). Folate is a precursor to the amino acid
methionine. The body uses [methionine](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hypermethioninemia) to make proteins, red and white blood cells, DNA, and other important compounds, including neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. Folate deficiency may cause [fatigue, pins and needles (paraesthesia), muscle weakness, disturbed vision, depression, confusion, and memory problems](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000354.htm). This gene is located on chromosome 1.

# What are some common variants of MTHFR?
 
A variant is a change at a specific point in the gene from the expected nucleotide sequence to another, resulting in incorrect enzyme function. There are two common variants in MTHFR: [C677T](http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/variant/1-11856378-G-A) and [A1298C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=1801131).

    # What does this mean?

    People with this variant have one copy of the [C677T](http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/variant/1-11856378-G-A) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    People with the following variants have a slightly reduced efficacy of processing folate [(82% of normal function)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009). In ME/CFS, [hypomethylation](http://dx.doi.org/10.4172/2155-9899.1000228), which is greatly affected by the vitamins B12 and folate, is seen in a majority of certain immune cells. The low B12 and higher homocysteine levels correlate significantly with ratings of [mental fatigue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009).

    # What should I do about this?

    Some people with mild loss of function variant may benefit from supplementing their diets with an [oral folic acid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009) supplement. Consult your physician.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    People with the following mutations have a drastically reduced efficacy of processing folate ([30% of normal function)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009).  In ME/CFS, [hypomethylation](http://dx.doi.org/10.4172/2155-9899.1000228), which is greatly affected by the vitamins B12 and folate, is seen in a majority of certain immune cells.

    Most people with the moderate loss of function variant may benefit from supplementing their diets with an [oral folic acid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009) supplement. However, opioid analgesics and other drugs that have to be demethylated (the removal of one methyl CH3 group) as part of their metabolism negatively impact MTHFR function.  Consult your physician.

    People with this variant have two copies of the  variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    People with the following mutations have a drastically reduced efficiency of processing folate ([15% of normal function](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009).  The elevated homocysteine levels are associated with low thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism), chronic conditions like obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol, physical inactivity, and high blood pressure. However, very high homocysteine levels are rarely caused by only these variants. 

    In ME/CFS, [hypomethylation](http://dx.doi.org/10.4172/2155-9899.1000228), which is greatly affected by the vitamins B12 and folate, is seen in a majority of certain immune cells. The low B12 and very elevated homocysteine levels correlate significantly with ratings of [mental fatigue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009).

    # What should I do about this?
    
    It is strongly recommended that people in this group take an [oral folic acid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009) supplement on a daily basis to provide blood saturations high enough to be a remedy for good and safe relief in CFS patients. However, opioid analgesics and other drugs that have to be demethylated (the removal of one methyl CH3 group) as part of their metabolism negatively impact MTHFR function. You should also be carefully evaluated for other factors known to affect [homocysteine](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/1017.html), such as:

    * Eye lens dislocations
    * Unusual (Marfan type) body shape
    * Stroke
    * Blood clotting abnormalities
    * Low thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism)
