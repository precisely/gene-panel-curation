# What does the <gene_symbol> gene do?

<gene_symbol> is important for its role in processing the vitamin folate
(also known as B9). Folate is a precursor to the amino acid
methionine. The body uses methionine to make proteins and other
important compounds, including neurotransmitters such as serotonin,
dopamine, and norepinephrine.

This gene is located on chormosone 1, and the enzyme it produces is found in your endocrine system and pancreas.

<varinant viewer with the gene>

<C677T variant view with c to T transformation>

This mutation is a change at a specific point in the <gene_symbol> gene from cytosine (C) to thymine (T), resulting in reduced enzymatic activity.  This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a mis-sense mutation.

<A1298C variant view with a to c transformation>

This mutation is a change at a specific point in the <gene_symbol> gene from adenine (A) to cytosine (C), resulting in reduced enzymatic activity.  This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a mis-sense mutation.

# How sure are you?

        <level graph>
          We have low confidence of this gene due to the data our chipset provides.

# What are the effects of variants in <gene_symbol>?

For the vast majority of people, the overall risk associated with the
common <gene_symbol> variants is small, and do not impact
treatment. It is possible that variants in this gene interact with
other gene variants, which is the reason for our inclusion of this
gene in the gene panel.
