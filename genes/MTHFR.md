# What does the MTHFR gene do?

MTHFR is involved in the production of folate (also known as B9).  Folate is a precursor to the amino acid
methionine.  The body uses [methionine](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hypermethioninemia) to make proteins, red and white blood cells, DNA, and other important compounds, including neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine.  Folate deficiency may cause [fatigue, 
pins and needles (paraesthesia), muscle weakness, disturbed vision, depression,  confusion, and memory problems](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000354.htm).

This gene is located on chromosome 1.  The enzyme it creates acts in your endocrine system and pancreas.

# What are some common mutations of MTHFR?
 
There are two well known variants in MTHFR: [C677T](http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/variant/1-11856378-G-A) and [A1298C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=1801131).

<# C677T #>
  <Variant hgvs="NC_000022.11:g.19963748G>A" name="C677T"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the MTHFR gene from cytosine (C) to thymine (T) resulting in incorrect enzyme function.  This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.
 
</Variant>
<# A1298C #>
  <Variant hgvs="NC_000022.11:g.19962712C>T" name="A1298C"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the MTHFR gene from adenine (A) to cytosine (C) resulting in incorrect enzyme function.  This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.

# How do changes in MTHFR affect people?

For the vast majority of people, the overall risk associated with the common MTHFR variants is small and does not impact treatment. It is possible that variants in this gene interact with other gene variants, which is the reason for our inclusion of this gene.

# Mild Loss of Function

People with the following variants have a slightly reduced efficacy of processing folate [(82% of normal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009)).  In ME/CFS, [hypomethylation](http://dx.doi.org/10.4172/2155-9899.1000228), which is greatly affected by the vitamins B12 and folate, is seen in a majority of certain immune cells.  The low B12 and homocysteine levels correlated significantly with ratings of [mental fatigue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009).

# What should I do about this?

Some people with mild loss of function variant may benefit from supplementing their diets with an [oral folic acid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009) supplement.  Consult your physician. 

<# A1298C (A:C) C677T (T:T) #>

# Moderate Loss of Function

People with the following mutations have a drastically reduced efficcacy of processing folate ([30% of normal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009)).   In ME/CFS, [hypomethylation](http://dx.doi.org/10.4172/2155-9899.1000228), which is greatly affected by the vitamins B12 and folate, is seen in a majority of certain immune cells.  The low B12 and homocysteine levels correlated significantly with ratings of [mental fatigue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009).

# What should I do about this?

Most people with moderate loss of function variant may benefit from supplementing their diets with an [oral folic acid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009) supplement. However, opioid analgesics and other drugs that have to be demethylated (the removal of one methyl CH3 group) as part of their metabolism cause worse MTHRF function.   Consult your physician. 

<# C677T (C;T) ; A1298C (A;C) #>

# Severe Loss of Function

People with the following mutations have a drastically reduced efficiency of processing folate ([15% of normal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009)).   The elevated levels of homocysteine levels are associated with low thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism), chronic conditions like obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol, physical inactivity, and high blood pressure.  However, very high homocysteine levels rarely result from having the common variants alone.  

In ME/CFS, [hypomethylation](http://dx.doi.org/10.4172/2155-9899.1000228), which is greatly affected by the vitamins B12 and folate, is seen in a majority of certain immune cells.  The low B12 and homocysteine levels correlated significantly with ratings of [mental fatigue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009).

# What should I do about this?

It is strongly recommended that people in this group take an [oral folic acid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009) supplement on a daily basis to provide blood saturations high enough to be a remedy for good and safe relief in CFS patients.  However, 
opioid analgesics and other drugs that have to be demethylated (the removal of one methyl CH3 group) as part of their metabolism cause worse MTHRF function.  You should also be carefully evaluated for other factors known to affect [homocysteine](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/1017.html), such as:

* Eye lens dislocations
* Unusual (Marfan type) body shape
* Stroke
* Blood clotting abnormalities
* Low thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism)
