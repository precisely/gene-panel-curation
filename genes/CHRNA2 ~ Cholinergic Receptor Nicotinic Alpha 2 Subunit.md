# What does the CHRNA2 gene do?

[CHRNA2](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q15822) creates a protein that is part of a nicotine receptor in the brain. This receptor binds to [acetylcholine](https://www.britannica.com/science/acetylcholine), the chief neurotransmitter controlling muscle contraction, blood vessel dilation, and heart rate. After it binds to acetylcholine, channels in cells are opened to transport [electrically charged particles (ions) essential for cellular function.](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q15822) Variants in CHRNA2 are linked to [epilepsy](http://www.uniprot.org/diseases/DI-00821), [seizures](https://www.omim.org/entry/601764), [nicotine dependence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24467848), and [ME](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524)[/CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24253422). This gene is located on chromosome 8.

# What are some common variants of CHRNA2?
 
A variant is a change at a specific point in the gene from the expected nucleotide sequence to another, resulting in incorrect protein function. There are five common variants in CHRNA2: [C65T (p.Thr22Ile)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/128740/), [A27468610G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=2741343), [A373G (p.Thr125Ala)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/128739/), [T836A (p.Ile279Asn)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/17504/), and [889A>T (p.Ile297Phe)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/522582/).

    # What does this mean?

    People with this variant have two copies of the [C65T (p.Thr22Ile)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/128740/) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    Your variant is associated with [nicotine dependency](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24253422), especially in [East Asians](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24253422). Your nicotine receptors are malformed and [less sensitive to nicotine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24467848), which may lead to addiction. For ME/CFS patients, [previous and current smoking](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25811400) are associated with a [3X higher risk of severe cognitive and sleep symptoms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28633629), including trouble concentrating and unrefreshing sleep. Additionally, ME/CFS patients also may have [higher levels of nicotine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26983655) in the brain as compared to the general population. High nicotine levels are associated with symptoms, including [abdominal pain, stress, fainting, depression, muscle weakness, muscle twitching, headache, and dizziness](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002510.htm), which may be worsened by smoking.

    # What should I do about this?

    People should not smoke. If you do smoke, be aware of your risk for [dependency](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24253422). ME/CFS patients should monitor their symptoms, including [pain, stress, POTS, and depression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26983655).

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    Your variant is [11X](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524) more common in [ME/CFS patients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524). It causes the CHRNA2 protein to be malformed, which impacts natural killer cell (NKC) activity. Natural killer cells are a type of white blood cell found in the blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes. They kill viral infected cells and tumorous cells. Many patients with ME/CFS have NKC with lower functional ability to fight infections, and [this impairment is associated with increased illness severity](https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/about/possible-causes.html). Compared with the general population, CFS patients have NKC that are [half as effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524).

    # What should I do about this?

    [Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), including suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and valproic acid,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17349632/) impair NKC function and should be avoided.

    Pharmaceuticals that increase natural killer cell function include:

    - [Antiviral drugs such as acyclovir and ganciclovir](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353) may improve cellular function. 
    - [Papillomavirus therapies, including topical agents and immunostimulants,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353) may activate NK cells. 
    - [Cytokine therapies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353), such as [IFN-α](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/bio-therapies-fact-sheet) in CNKD1, may induce higher levels of NKC activity by [activating white blood cells](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/bio-therapies-fact-sheet). 

    Dietary supplements that increase natural killer cell function include:

    - [Resveratrol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4855330/) dietary supplements stimulate the immune system by increasing NKC function. 
    - [Myricetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075019), found in food and red wine, may increase NKC activity. 
    - [Quercetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19449452), found in onions and fruits, may improve NKC and T cell function. 
    - [Bulgarian yogurt fermented with L. delbrueckii ssp. Bulgaricus augments NKC activity.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26686726) 
    - [Zinc](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27021581) helps to improve immune system activity and response.  
    - [Inositol hexaphosphate (IP6), found in germ, bran, and whole kernel corn](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11366552) may activate the immune system and help fight bacterial and fungal infections.

Your homozygous [T836A (p.Ile279Asn) (A;A)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/17504/) variant is associated with [nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16826524), which means epileptic attacks caused by [sleep](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25770198). These attacks may include feelings of fear, tongue movements, and sleepwalking, which closely resembles nightmares and sleep walking, and may mimic sleep issues associated with ME/CFS.

    # What should I do about this?

    Doctors use brain scans and other tests to diagnose epilepsy. There is no cure for epilepsy, but it can be controlled by medication. Consult your physician on [medications]([http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q15822](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q15822)) associated with CHRNA2 including: [Atracurium besylate](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00732), [Biperiden](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00810), [Carbachol](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00411), [Cisatracurium besylate](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00565), [Decamethonium](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01245), [Dextromethorphan](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00514), [Doxacurium chloride](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01135), [Ethanol](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00898), [Galantamine](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00674), [Gallamine Triethiodide](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00483), [Mecamylamine](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00657), [Metocurine](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01336), [Metocurine Iodide](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00416), [Mivacurium](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01226), [Nicotine](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00184), [Pancuronium](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01337), [Pipecuronium](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01338), [Procaine](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00721), [Rocuronium](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00728), [RPI-78M](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB05740), [Tubocurarine](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01199), and [Vecuronium](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01339).

    Other treatments may include surgery, [Vagus Nerve Stimulation](https://www.aan.com/Guidelines/Home/GetGuidelineContent/619), or [special diets](https://medlineplus.gov/epilepsy.html).  Lifestyle changes include:
    - Recognize seizure triggers (such as [stress](https://www.cdc.gov/epilepsy/managing-epilepsy/index.htm)), and lower your risk
    - Keep a record of your [seizures](https://www.cdc.gov/epilepsy/managing-epilepsy/index.htm) to help identify patterns
    - Get enough [sleep](https://www.cdc.gov/epilepsy/managing-epilepsy/index.htm)
    - Maintain a strong [social support network](https://www.cdc.gov/epilepsy/managing-epilepsy/index.htm)

    ME/CFS patients should consider a brain scan or sleep study to rule out if nocturnal epilepsy is causing sleep issues.
