# What does the CHRNA2 gene do?

[CHRNA2](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q15822) creates a protein that is part of a nicotine receptor in the brain. This receptor binds to [acetylcholine](https://www.britannica.com/science/acetylcholine), the chief neurotransmitter controlling muscle contraction, blood vessel dilation, and heart rate. After it binds to acetylcholine, channels in cells are opened to transport [electrically charged particles (ions) essential for cellular function.](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q15822) Variants in CHRNA2 are linked to [epilepsy](http://www.uniprot.org/diseases/DI-00821), [seizures](https://www.omim.org/entry/601764), [nicotine dependence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24467848), and [ME](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524)[/CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24253422). This gene is located on chromosome 8.

# What are some common variants of CHRNA2?
 
A variant is a change at a specific point in the gene from the expected nucleotide sequence to another, resulting in incorrect protein function. There are five common variants in CHRNA2: [C65T (p.Thr22Ile)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/128740/), [A27468610G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=2741343), [A373G (p.Thr125Ala)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/128739/), [T836A (p.Ile279Asn)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/17504/), and [889A>T (p.Ile297Phe)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/522582/).

    # What does this mean?

    People with this variant have two copies of the [C65T (p.Thr22Ile)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/128740/) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    Your variant is associated with [nicotine dependency](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24253422), especially in [East Asians](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24253422). Your nicotine receptors are malformed and [less sensitive to nicotine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24467848), which may lead to addiction. For ME/CFS patients, [previous and current smoking](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25811400) are associated with a [3X higher risk of severe cognitive and sleep symptoms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28633629), including trouble concentrating and unrefreshing sleep. Additionally, ME/CFS patients also may have [higher levels of nicotine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26983655) in the brain as compared to the general population. High nicotine levels are associated with symptoms, including [abdominal pain, stress, fainting, depression, muscle weakness, muscle twitching, headache, and dizziness](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002510.htm), which may be worsened by smoking.

    # What should I do about this?

    People should not smoke. If you do smoke, be aware of your risk for dependency or increased difficulty of quitting smoking.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

"Your homozygous variant may affect your immune system.  Natural killer cells (NKC) are a type of white blood cells found in the blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes. They kill viral infected cells and tumorous cells. CFS patients have half the cellular efficiency of the normal population with a [17% cellular death rate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524). The A27468610G (C;C) variant decreases gene expression in both the DNA and RNA, causing significant reduction in NKC activity. This variant was [11X more common in CFS patients at 91.7% compared to 8.3% of the normal population.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524)

    # What should I do about this?

    Many dietary supplements have been found to increase or decrease natural killer cell (NKC) function.

    - [Resveratrol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4855330/) stimulates the immune system in increase NKC activity, but sufficient body concentration can only be achieved through supplementation. 
    - [Myricetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075019), a flavonoid found in food and red wine, can increase NKC activity. 
    - [Quercetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19449452), a flavonoid in onions and fruits may improve NKC and T cell function. 

    [Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) including suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and valproric acid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17349632/) impair NKC function, and should be avoided.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

"Epilepsy is a brain disorder that causes people to have recurring seizures. The brain sends wrong signals and may cause uncontrollable muscle spasms or fainting. Your homozygous [T836A (p.Ile279Asn) (A;A)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/17504/)
variant is associated with nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, which means epileptic attacks caused by sleep. These attacks may include feelings of fear, tongue movements, and sleepwalking, which closely resembles nightmares and sleep walking, and may mimic sleep issues associated with ME/CFS.

# What should I do about this?

Doctors use brain scans and other tests to diagnose epilepsy. It is important to start treatment right away. There is no cure for epilepsy, but it can be controlled by medication. Consult your physician on [medications](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q15822) associated with CHRNA2 including: Atracurium besylate, Biperiden, Carbachol, Cisatracurium besylate, Decamethonium, Dextromethorphan, Doxacurium chloride, Ethanol, Galantamine, Gallamine Triethiodide, Mecamylamine, Metocurine, Metocurine Iodide, Mivacurium, Nicotine, Pancuronium, Pipecuronium, Procaine, Rocuronium, RPI-78M, Tubocurarine, and Vecuronium.

Other treatments may include surgery, Vagus Nerve Stimulation, or special diets.  Lifestyle changes include:
* Recognize seizure triggers (such as stress), and lower your risk
* Keep a record of your seizures to help identify patterns
* Get enough sleep
* Maintain a strong social support network

ME/CFS patients should consider a brain scan or sleep study to rule out if nocturnal epilepsy is causing sleep issues."
