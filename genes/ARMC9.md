# What are some common mutations of ARMC9?
       
There are two well-known variants in ARMC9: [C78606381T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=16827966) and [G56871895A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=6445832).

<# C231342446T #>
 <Variant hgvs="NC_000002.12:g.231342446C>T" name="C231342446T"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the ARMC9 gene from cytosine (C) to thymine (T) resulting in incorrect  function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.
 
</Variant>
<# G56871895A #>
 <Variant hgvs="NC_000003.12:g.56871895G>A" name="G56871895A"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the ARMC9 gene from guanine (G) to adenine (A) resulting in incorrect  function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.
