# What are some common mutations of IL12B?
 
There are three variants in IL12B: [C1095A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/352554/), [T159323005C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=2288831), and [A159C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/352569/).

<# C1095A #>
  <Variant hgvs="NC_000005.10:g.159315006G>T" name="C1095A"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the IL12B gene from cytosine (C) to adenine (A) resulting in incorrect protein function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.

  </Variant>
<# T159323005C #>
  <Variant hgvs="NC_000005.10:g.159323005T>C" name="T159323005C"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the IL12B gene from thymine (T) to cytosine (C) resulting in incorrect protein function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.

  </Variant>
<# A159C #>
  <Variant hgvs="NC_000005.10:g.159315942T>G" name="A159C"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the IL12B gene from adenine (A) to cytosine (C) resulting in incorrect protein function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.

    # What does this mean?
 
    People with this variant have one copy of the [C1095A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/352554/) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

# How do changes in IL12B affect people?

For the vast majority of people, the overall risk associated with the common IL12B variants is small and does not impact treatment. It is possible that variants in this gene interact with other gene variants, which is the reason for our inclusion of this gene.
