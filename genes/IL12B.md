# What are some common mutations of IL12B?
 
There are three common variants in IL12B: [C1095A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/352554/), [T159323005C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=2288831), and [A159C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/352569/).

<# C1095A #>
  <Variant hgvs="NC_000005.10:g.159315006G>T" name="C1095A"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the IL12B gene from cytosine (C) to adenine (A) resulting in incorrect protein function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.

  </Variant>
<# T159323005C #>
  <Variant hgvs="NC_000005.10:g.159323005T>C" name="T159323005C"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the IL12B gene from thymine (T) to cytosine (C) resulting in incorrect protein function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.

  </Variant>
<# A159C #>
  <Variant hgvs="NC_000005.10:g.159315942T>G" name="A159C"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the IL12B gene from adenine (A) to cytosine (C) resulting in incorrect protein function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.

    # What does this mean?
 
    People with this variant have one copy of the [C1095A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/352554/) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.
