# What does the CRHR1 gene do?

[CRHR1](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P34998) encodes a protein that binds to a neurotransmitter for hormones. These hormones are necessary for normal embryonic development and act in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) pathway, controlling [stress, reproduction, immune response, and obesity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1394). CRHR1 also helps activate enzymes to help transfer the effects of hormones into cells and activate proteins. Variants in CRHR1 have been linked with [depression](http://www.disgenet.org/web/DisGeNET/menu/browser/tab8a?0&pview=default&pf=http://www.disgenet.org/web/DisGeNET%3Fdata/genes::1394::de&pf=/data/sources::ALL::de), [Parkinsonâ€™s](https://www.targetvalidation.org/target/ENSG00000263715/associations?view=t:table), and [ME](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26063326)/[CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18986552). This gene is located on chromosome 17.

# What are some common mutations of CRHR1?
 
There are two common variants in CRHR1: [A45815234G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=242940) and [G45825631A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=1396862).

<# A45815234G #>
  <Variant hgvs="NC_000017.11:g.45815234A>G" name="A45815234G"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the CRHR1 gene from adenine (A) to guanine (G) resulting in incorrect protein function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.

  <Genotype hgvs="NC_000017.11:g.[45815234A>G];[45815234=]" name="A45815234G"> 

    # What does this mean?
 
    People with this variant have one copy of the [A45815234G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=242940) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    Your variant may cause a change in the HPA axis and is mildly associated with [increased severity of ME/CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18986552).

    [ME/CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21549189) has been associated with lower levels of HPA activity, which may be caused by a variety of [immune system abnormalities, inflammation, and oxidative stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27766535). This may cause [mild hypocortisolism, improper cortisol cycles, and incorrect or depressed HPA axis response](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21946893), which correlate with increased disability and poorer response to standard treatment.

    Hypocortisolism (or a lack of cortisol) causes decreased response to stress and heightened negative feedback. The corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system, including CRHR1, is a major part of the stress response and mediates both the initial and sustained responses to stress. It [maintains blood pressure and heart function, mediates the immune response, and controls the metabolism](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/endocrine-diseases/adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease). Impairment due to hypocortisolism may lead to and perpetuate many CFS symptoms, including [pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17596739), [fatigue, muscle weakness, and POTS](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/endocrine-diseases/adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease).

    Disruption of the HPA axis [causing improper immune system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15467349) response is also linked to ME/CFS. Improper stress response mediated by CRHR1 may cause too many white blood cells to be created in response to attack. This [hyper-immune](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15949897) state leads the brain to organize a sickness response that may be overly sensitive in response to any stressor. Patients may then feel ill without sufficient external cause.

    # What should I do about this?

    [Oxidative stress and decreased antioxidant capacity in ME/CFS patients caused by HPA disruption](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21549189) may be mitigated through environmental changes, [antioxidants](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/antioxidants/introduction.htm), and dietary changes.

    * Avoid [ionizing radiation, smoking, metals, and high oxygen atmospheres](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/antioxidants-fact-sheet#q1).
    * Consider a diet higher in [antioxidants, including vitamins C and E, and selenium, as well as carotenoids, such as beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/antioxidants/introduction.htm).
    * Consider eating [red, blue, purple berries like blueberries and cranberries, orange and dark, leafy green vegetables like pumpkin and spinach, tomato, red grapes, and peanuts](https://www.fruitsandveggiesmorematters.org/what-are-phytochemicals).

    Patients should check their cortisol levels. Cortisol levels may be reduced due to [inactivity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21946893), [depression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21946893), or [early-life stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21946893). 
    * If too low, consider [psychotropic medication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21946893) and cognitive behavioral therapy ([CBT](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21946893)). Consult your physician. 
    * If elevated consider [magnesium](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18500945), [omega-3 fish oil]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12909818), [massage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16162447), [Withania somnifera (ashwagandha) root extract](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23439798), and [high-dose vitamin C]([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11862365](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11862365)). Consult your physician. 

    CRHR1 medication includes [Corticorelin ovine triflutate](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB09067), but [steroid replacement](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21946893) is not recommended.
