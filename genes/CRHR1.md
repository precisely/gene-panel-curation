# What are some common mutations of CRHR1?
 
There are three common variants in CRHR1: [A45815234G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=242940), [T159323005C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=685828), and [G45825631A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=1396862).

<# A45815234G #>
  <Variant hgvs="NC_000017.11:g.45815234A>G" name="A45815234G"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the CRHR1 gene from adenine (A) to guanine (G) resulting in incorrect protein function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.

  </Variant>
<# T159323005C #>
  <Variant hgvs="NC_000011.10:g.101073644G>T" name="T159323005C"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the CRHR1 gene from guanine (G) to thymine (T) resulting in incorrect protein function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.

  </Variant>
<# G45825631A #>

# How do changes in CRHR1 affect people?

For the vast majority of people, the overall risk associated with the common CRHR1 variants is small and does not impact treatment. It is possible that variants in this gene interact with other gene variants, which is the reason for our inclusion of this gene.
