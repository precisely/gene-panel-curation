# What does the CHRNA3 gene do?

CHRNA3 (Neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-3) encodes a nicotine neurotransmitter receptor protein called [acetylcholine](http://www.uniprot.org/citations/8906617).  It also controls [ion](http://www.uniprot.org/citations/20438829) and [serotonin](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/term/GO:0022850) channels in the brain.   Variants in this gene have been associated with [nicotine dependence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22290489), increased daily [cigarette consumption](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23870182), [lung cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19836008), COPD, [cocaine dependence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20485328), and [CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524). 

This gene is located on chromosome 15.  The protein it creates acts in your brain and nervous system and immune system.

 # What are some common mutations of CHRNA3?
 
There are two well known variants in CHRNA3: [C78606381T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=12914385) and [C645T ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/17503/).

<# C78606381T #>
  <Variant hgvs="NC_000015.10:g.78606381C>T" name="C78606381T"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the CHRNA3 gene from cytosine (C) to thymine (T) resulting in incorrect protein function.  This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.
 
</Variant>
<# C645T  #>
  <Variant hgvs="NC_000015.10:g.78601997G>A" name="C645T "> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the CHRNA3 gene from guanine (G) to adenine (A) resulting in incorrect protein function.  This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.

# How do changes in CHRNA3 affect people?

For the vast majority of people, the overall risk associated with the common CHRNA3 variants is small, and do not impact treatment. It is possible that variants in this gene interact with other gene variants, which is the reason for our inclusion of this gene.
