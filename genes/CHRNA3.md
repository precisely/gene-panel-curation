# What does the CHRNA3 gene do?

CHRNA3 (Neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-3) encodes a nicotine neurotransmitter receptor protein called [acetylcholine](http://www.uniprot.org/citations/8906617).  It also controls [ion](http://www.uniprot.org/citations/20438829) and [serotonin](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/term/GO:0022850) channels in the brain.   Variants in this gene have been associated with [nicotine dependence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22290489), increased daily [cigarette consumption](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23870182), [lung cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19836008), [COPD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621683), [cocaine dependence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20485328), and [CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524). 

This gene is located on chromosome 15.  The protein it creates acts in your brain and nervous system and immune system.

# How do changes in CHRNA3 affect people?

For the vast majority of people, the overall risk associated with the common CHRNA3 variants is small, and do not impact treatment. It is possible that variants in this gene interact with other gene variants, which is the reason for our inclusion of this gene.

# Mild Risk

The CHRNA3 protein plays a role in developing nicotine dependence and regulating nicotine receptor proliferation and destruction.  Incorrect formation of the nicotine neurotransmitter receptor protein has a variety of effects.  This heterozygous variant causes increased risk of [lung cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23094028), with an [odds ratio of 1.2]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28827732), and [COPD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621683), with an [odds ratio of 1.39](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621683).  It causes an [increase](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29030599) of [one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21559498)  [cigarette](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23870182) [per day](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20418890) and may also cause [smoking persistence]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22290489).  However, the C allele is protective, with a [decrease of 3.25 packs per year per C allele](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21436384). Finally, his variant may cause an increase in [cocaine dependence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20485328).

# What should I do about this?

People also should not smoke or use cocaine.  If you do smoke, be aware of your risk for dependency and increased difficulty of quitting smoking.

[Medications](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P32297) indicated for use for CHRNA3 issues include: [Bupropion](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01156), [Cytisine](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB09028), [Dextromethorphan](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00514), [Ethanol](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00898), [Galantamine](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00674), [Levamisole](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00848), [Levomethadyl Acetate](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01227), [Nicotine](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00184), [Pentolinium](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01090), and [Varenicline](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01273).

<# C78606381T (T;T) #>

# Moderate Risk

The CHRNA3 protein plays a role in developing nicotine dependence and regulating nicotine receptor proliferation and destruction.  Incorrect formation of the nicotine neurotransmitter receptor protein has a variety of effects.  This homozygous variant causes greatly increased risk of [lung cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23094028), with an [odds ratio of 1.44](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21559498), and [COPD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621683), with an [odds ratio of 1.39](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621683).     It causes an [increase](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29030599) of [two](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21559498) [cigarettes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23870182) [per day](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20418890) and may also cause greatly increased [smoking persistence]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22290489). This variant may cause an increase in [cocaine dependence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20485328).   

Natural killer cells (NKC) are a type of white blood cells found in the blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes. They kill viral infected cells and tumorous cells. CFS patients have half the cellular efficiency of the normal population with a [17% cellular death
rate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524). The C78606381T (T;T) variant decreases gene expression in both the DNA and RNA, causing significant reduction in NKC activity. This variant was five as common in [CFS patients at 85.7% with an odds ratio of 6.22.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524)

# What should I do about this?

People also should not smoke or use cocaine.  If you do smoke, be aware of your greatly increased risk for dependency and difficulty of quitting smoking, and consider regular checks for lung cancer.

[Medications](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P32297) indicated for use for CHRNA3 issues include: [Bupropion](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01156), [Cytisine](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB09028), [Dextromethorphan](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00514), [Ethanol](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00898), [Galantamine](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00674), [Levamisole](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00848), [Levomethadyl Acetate](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01227), [Nicotine](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00184), [Pentolinium](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01090), and [Varenicline](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01273).

Many dietary supplements have been found to increase or decrease natural killer cell function.
*   [Resveratrol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4855330/) stimulates the immune system in increase NKC activity, but
    sufficient body concentration can only be achieved through supplementation.
*   [Myricetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075019), a flavonoid found in food and red wine, can increase NKC activity.
*   [Quercetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19449452), a flavonoid in onions and fruits may improve NKC and T cell function.
*   [Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) including suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and valproric acid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17349632/) impair NKC function, and should be avoided.
