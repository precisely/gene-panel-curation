<Gene_Name CHRNA3 />

<GeneName_full Neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-3 />

# What does the CHRNA3 gene do?

CHRNA3 encodes a neurotransmitter called [acetylcholine](http://www.uniprot.org/citations/8906617) that regulates the creation and destruction of nicotine receptors in the nervous system. It also controls [serotonin](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/term/GO:0022850) channels in the brain. Variants in this gene have been associated with [nicotine dependence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22290489), [lung cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19836008), [COPD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621683) (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), [cocaine dependence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20485328), and ME/[CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524). This gene is located on chromosome 15.

# What are some common variants of CHRNA3?
 
A variant is a change at a specific point in the gene from the expected nucleotide sequence to another, resulting in incorrect protein function. There are two common variants in CHRNA3: [C78606381T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=12914385) and [C645T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/17503/).

    # What does this mean?

    People with this variant have one copy of the [C78606381T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=12914385) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    The CHRNA3 protein plays a role in developing nicotine dependence and regulating nicotine receptor proliferation and destruction. Incorrect formation of the nicotine neurotransmitter receptor protein has a variety of effects. This heterozygous variant causes increased risk of [lung cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23094028), with an [odds ratio of 1.2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28827732), and [COPD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621683), with an [odds ratio of 1.39](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621683). It causes an [increase](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29030599) of [one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21559498)[cigarette](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23870182)[per day](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20418890) and may also cause [smoking persistence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22290489). However, the C allele is protective, with a [decrease of 3.25 packs per year per C allele](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21436384). Finally, his variant may cause an increase in [cocaine dependence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20485328).

    # What should I do about this?

    People should not smoke or use cocaine. If you do smoke, be aware of your risk for dependency and increased difficulty of quitting smoking.

    [Many factors may decrease your risk of lung cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/types/lung/patient/lung-prevention-pdq#section/all):

    - Avoid cigarette, cigar, pipe smoking, and secondhand smoke. 
    - Have less than one alcoholic drink per day. 
    - Practice safe sex, and avoid HIV infection. 
    - Avoid radiation exposure, including atomic bomb radiation, radiation therapy, imaging tests, and radon. 
    - Avoid environmental toxins such as asbestos, arsenic, chromium, nickel, beryllium, cadmium, tar, soot, and air pollution.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    The CHRNA3 protein plays a role in developing nicotine dependence and regulating nicotine receptor proliferation and destruction. Incorrect formation of the nicotine neurotransmitter receptor protein has a variety of effects. This homozygous variant causes greatly increased risk of [lung cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23094028), with an [odds ratio of 1.44](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21559498), and [COPD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621683), with an [odds ratio of 1.39](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621683). It causes an [increase](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29030599) of [two](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21559498)[cigarettes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23870182)[per day](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20418890) and may also cause greatly increased [smoking persistence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22290489). This variant may cause an increase in [cocaine dependence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20485328).

    Natural killer cells (NKC) are a type of white blood cells found in the blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes. They kill viral infected cells and tumorous cells. CFS patients have half the cellular efficiency of the normal population with a [17% cellular death rate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524). The C78606381T (T;T) variant decreases gene expression in both the DNA and RNA, causing significant reduction in NKC activity. This variant was five as common in [CFS patients at 85.7% with an odds ratio of 6.22.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524)

    Many dietary supplements have been found to increase or decrease natural killer cell (NKC) function.

    - [Resveratrol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4855330/) stimulates the immune system in increase NKC activity, but sufficient body concentration can only be achieved through supplementation. 
    - [Myricetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075019), a flavonoid found in food and red wine, can increase NKC activity. 
    - [Quercetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19449452), a flavonoid in onions and fruits may improve NKC and T cell function. 

    [Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) including suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and valproric acid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17349632/) impair NKC function, and should be avoided.

    The CHRNA3 protein plays a role in developing nicotine dependence and regulating nicotine receptor proliferation and destruction. Incorrect formation of the nicotine neurotransmitter receptor protein has a variety of effects. This homozygous variant causes greatly increased risk of [lung cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23094028), with an [odds ratio of 1.44](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21559498), and [COPD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621683), with an [odds ratio of 1.39](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621683). It causes an [increase](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29030599) of [two](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21559498)[cigarettes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23870182)[per day](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20418890) and may also cause greatly increased [smoking persistence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22290489). This variant may cause an increase in [cocaine dependence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20485328).

    Natural killer cells (NKC) are a type of white blood cells found in the blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes. They kill viral infected cells and tumorous cells. CFS patients have half the cellular efficiency of the normal population with a [17% cellular death rate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524). The C78606381T (T;T) variant decreases gene expression in both the DNA and RNA, causing significant reduction in NKC activity. This variant was five as common in [CFS patients at 85.7% with an odds ratio of 6.22.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524).

    # What is the effect of C645T (C;T)?

    This heterozygous variant causes increased risk of [adenocarcinoma](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27072204) and [squamous cell lung cancer among Caucasians and African Americans](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24254305), with an [odds ratio of 2.25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24337855), but not in East Asians or people who have never smoked. It causes an increase in [cigarettes smoked per day](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27663783)[(odds ratio 2.66)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25632390) and [severity of nicotine addiction (odds ratio 2.6)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25632390). There is a [2.9% decrease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25891233) in adherence to prescribed Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) dose, and a [1.0mg decrease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25891233) in daily NRT consumption up to 28 days after beginning treatment. Physical changes associated with one T allele include [0.59 kg lower body weight, 0.23 kg/m(2) lower body mass index, 0.32 cm lower waist circumference, and 0.45 cm lower hip circumference](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25777141). It also is associated with [higher resting heart rate, lower systolic blood pressure, and higher HDL cholesterol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24867305).

     # What should I do about this?

    People should not smoke or use cocaine. If you do smoke, be aware of your greatly increased risk for dependency and difficulty of quitting smoking, and consider regular checks for lung cancer.

    [Many factors may decrease your risk of lung cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/types/lung/patient/lung-prevention-pdq#section/all):

    - Avoid cigarette, cigar, pipe smoking, and secondhand smoke. 
    - Have less than one alcoholic drink per day. 
    - Practice safe sex, and avoid HIV infection. 
    - Avoid radiation exposure, including atomic bomb radiation, radiation therapy, imaging tests, and radon. 
    - Avoid environmental toxins such as asbestos, arsenic, chromium, nickel, beryllium, cadmium, tar, soot, and air pollution. 
    - [Beta carotene supplements, made from yellow and orange fruits and vegetables and dark green, leafy vegetables,](https://www.cancer.gov/types/lung/patient/lung-prevention-pdq#section/all) may help reduce risk for heavy smokers. 

    [Medications](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P32297) indicated for use for CHRNA3 issues include: [Bupropion](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01156), [Cytisine](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB09028), [Dextromethorphan](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00514), [Ethanol](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00898), [Galantamine](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00674), [Levamisole](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00848), [Levomethadyl Acetate](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01227), [Nicotine](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00184), [Pentolinium](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01090), and [Varenicline](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01273).

    Many dietary supplements have been found to increase or decrease natural killer cell (NKC) function.

    - [Myricetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075019), a flavonoid found in food and red wine, can increase NKC activity. 
    - [Quercetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19449452), a flavonoid in onions and fruits may improve NKC and T cell function. 

    [Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) including suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and valproric acid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17349632/) impair NKC function, and should be avoided.
