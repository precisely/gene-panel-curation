# What are some common mutations of TPH2?
 
There are four common variants in TPH2: [A71942732G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=1007311), [A72018440G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=2741343), [A71966484G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/403250/), and [C71978821T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/14016/).

<# A71942732G #>
  <Variant hgvs="NC_000012.12:g.71942732A>G" name="A71942732G"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the TPH2 gene from adenine (A) to guanine (G) resulting in incorrect protein function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.

  </Variant>
<# A72018440G #>
  <Variant hgvs="NC_000012.12:g.72018440A>G" name="A72018440G"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the TPH2 gene from adenine (A) to guanine (G) resulting in incorrect protein function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.

<# A71966484G #>
  <Variant hgvs="NC_000012.12:g.71966484A>G" name="A71966484G"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the TPH2 gene from adenine (A) to guanine (G) resulting in incorrect protein function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.

  </Variant>
<# C71978821T #>
  <Variant hgvs="NC_000012.12:g.71978821C>T" name="C71978821T"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the TPH2 gene from cytosine (C) to thymine (T) resulting in incorrect protein function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.
