# What are some common mutations of TPH2?
 
There are four common variants in TPH2: [A71942732G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=1007311), [A72018440G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=2741343), [A71966484G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/403250/), and [C71978821T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/14016/).

<# A71942732G #>
  <Variant hgvs="NC_000012.12:g.71942732A>G" name="A71942732G"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the TPH2 gene from adenine (A) to guanine (G) resulting in incorrect protein function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.

# How do changes in TPH2 affect people?

For the vast majority of people, the overall risk associated with the common TPH2 variants is small and does not impact treatment. It is possible that variants in this gene interact with other gene variants, which is the reason for our inclusion of this gene.
