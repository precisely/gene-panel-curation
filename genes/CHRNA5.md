# What does the CHRNA5 gene do?

The CHRNA5 ([neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-5](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P30532)) gene creates a protein that operates [ion and cation channels](http://www.uniprot.org/citations/20438829) in the plasma membranes in neurons. These channels control [fast signal transmission at synapses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1138) and cause the bodyâ€™s response to [nicotine](http://www.uniprot.org/citations/18227835) and [neuromuscular synaptic transmission](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P30532). Variants in CHRNA5 cause [increased](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19443489) [susceptibility](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18385738) to [lung](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20643934) [cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18385739) and [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26771213). Variants that cause [increased](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1944348) [risk](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18385738) of [smoking](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18385739) also causes greater [difficulty](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20643934) in [cessation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28884473), greater numbers of [cigarettes smoked per day](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27344179), and higher rates of [anxiety](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25826680). Variants are also associated with [ME/CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524) due to natural killer cell (NKC) dysfunction.

This gene is located on chromosome 15. The protein it creates acts in your lungs, immune system, nervous system, and brain.

# Mild Risk

This heterozygous variant affects the brain in a variety of ways. It controls [cognitive function, working memory, and gray matter volume in the brain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819610). Males with this variant have faster [information processing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25674902), including [better behavioral performance, more efficient cortex activity, and larger gray matter volume](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819610), while females exhibit slower information processing. In general, people have worse [visual cognitive control](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24934182). This variant is the [strongest genetic risk factor for developing nicotine dependence in African Americans and Caucasians, with an odds ratio of 1.3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26239294). It may cause difficulties with smoking cessation and increases the number of [cigarettes smoked per day](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27344179). People are [15% less likely](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24727484) to be able to quit smoking, and they respond less well to [nicotine replacement therapy(NRT)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28884473). This may be caused due to the variant [increasing the pleasure and mental stimulation experienced after smoking, as well as withdrawal severity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25948103). This variant is also associated with a greater risk for [lung cancer and COPD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27344179).

# What should I do about this?

People should not smoke. If you do smoke, be aware of your risk for dependency and increased difficulty of quitting smoking. Consider regular checks for lung cancer.

[Many factors may decrease your risk of lung cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/types/lung/patient/lung-prevention-pdq#section/all):
*  Avoid cigarettes, cigars, pipe smoking, and secondhand smoke.
*  Have less than one alcoholic drink per day.
*  Practice safe sex, and avoid HIV infection.
*  Avoid radiation exposure, including atomic bomb radiation, radiation therapy, imaging tests, and radon.
*  Avoid environmental toxins, such as asbestos, arsenic, chromium, nickel, beryllium, cadmium, tar, soot, and sir pollution.
*  [Beta carotene supplements, made from yellow and orange fruits and vegetables and dark green, leafy vegetables,](https://www.cancer.gov/types/lung/patient/lung-prevention-pdq#section/all) may help reduce risk for heavy smokers.

[Medications](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P30532#pathology_and_biotech) used for treating CHRNA5 issues include [Ethanol](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00898), [Galantamine](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00674), and [nicotine](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00184).

# Moderate Risk

This variant controls [cognitive function, working memory, and gray matter volume in the brain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819610). Males with this variant have much faster [information processing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25674902), including [much better behavioral performance, more efficient cortex activity, and the largest gray matter volume](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819610), while females exhibit much slower information processing. In general, [visual cognitive control is impaired](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24934182). The brain changes caused by this variant is the [strongest genetic risk factor for developing nicotine dependence in African Americans and Caucasians, with an odds ratio of 1.3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26239294). People are [15% less likely](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24727484) to be able to quit smoking, respond much less well to [nicotine replacement therapy(NRT)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28884473), and are at risk for a greatly increased number of [cigarettes smoked per day](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27344179). This may be caused due to the variant [greatly increasing the pleasure and mental stimulation experienced after smoking, as well as withdrawal severity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25948103). The AA homozygous variant is associated with greatly elevated risk and earlier diagnosis of [lung cancer with an odds ratio of 1.65](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27543155), but not in [Asians](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26434895). It is also associated with [COPD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26771213) and [newborn pulmonary dysfunction and respiratory morbidities](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24838476) in the children of smoking mothers.

# What should I do about this?

People should not smoke. If you do smoke, be aware of your risk for dependency and increased difficulty of quitting smoking. Consider regular checks for lung cancer. Pregnant women should consider [supplemental vitamin C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24838476).

# Mild Risk

This variant acts in the brain in the [frontal cortex, temporal cortex, and pons](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26220977), controlling message transmission between the cortex and cerebellum, motor function, problem solving, memory formation and processing, language, judgement, impulse control, and sexual behavior. This variant also is associated with increased likelihood of [adenocarcinoma (ADC)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25233467) and an [increased number of cigarettes smoked per day](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26981579).

Additionally, it affects the immune system. Natural killer cells (NKC) are a type of white blood cells found in the blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes. They kill viral infected cells and tumorous cells. CFS patients have half the cellular efficiency of the normal population with a [17% cellular death rate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524). The A78581651T variant may decrease gene expression in both the DNA and RNA, causing significant reduction in NKC activity. This variant was 2X as common in [CFS patients with an odds ratio of 2.11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524).

# What should I do about this?

People should avoid smoking, and proactively check for lung cancer if they smoke.

Some pharmaceuticals may increase or decrease natural killer cell function.

- [Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), including suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and valproic acid,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17349632/) impair NKC function and should be avoided. 
- [Acyclovir, ganciclovir, and related prophylactic antiviral drugs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353) may improve cellular function. 
- [Therapies for papillomaviruses, topical agents, physical approaches and immunostimulants,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353) may activate NK cells. 
- [Cytokine therapies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353), such as [IFN-Î±](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/bio-therapies-fact-sheet) in CNKD1, may induce higher levels of NKC cytotoxic activity by [activating white blood cells](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/bio-therapies-fact-sheet). 
- Consider the [HPV vaccine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353) as issues with natural killer cells cause higher susceptibility. 

Many dietary supplements have been found to increase natural killer cell function.

- [Resveratrol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4855330/) stimulates the immune system by increasing NKC activity, but sufficient body concentration can only be achieved through supplementation. 
- [Myricetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075019), a flavonoid found in food and red wine, can increase NKC activity. 
- [Quercetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19449452), a flavonoid in onions and fruits, may improve NKC and T cell function. 
- [Bulgarian yogurt fermented with L. delbrueckii ssp. Bulgaricus augments NKC activity.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26686726)
