 # What are some common mutations of CHRNA5?
 
There are three well known variants in CHRNA5: [G1192A (Asp398Asn)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/17497/), [A78573551G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=6495306), and [A78581651T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=7180002).

<# G1192A #>
  <Variant hgvs="NC_000015.10:g.78590583G>A" name="G1192A"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the CHRNA5 gene from guanine (G) to adenine (A) resulting in incorrect protein function.  This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.
 
</Variant>
<# A78573551G #>
  <Variant hgvs="NC_000015.10:g.78573551G>A" name="A78573551G"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the CHRNA5 gene from adenine (A) to guanine (G) resulting in incorrect protein function.  This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.

</Variant>
<# A78581651T #>
  <Variant hgvs="NC_000015.10:g.78581651A>T" name="A78581651T"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the  gene from adenine (A) to thymine (T) resulting in incorrect two function.  This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.

# How do changes in CHRNA5 affect people?

For the vast majority of people, the overall risk associated with the common CHRNA5 variants is small, and do not impact treatment. It is possible that variants in this gene interact with other gene variants, which is the reason for our inclusion of this gene.
