# What does the CHRNA5 gene do?

[CHRNA5](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CHRNA5) creates a protein that controls signals between between [motor neurons and muscle fiber](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/term/GO:0007274)s as well as the body’s response to [nicotine](http://www.uniprot.org/citations/18227835). Variants in CHRNA5 are associated with [anxiety](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25826680) and decreased function of [natural killer cells (NKC)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524), a type of white blood cell that helps the body respond to viral infections. This gene is located on chromosome 15.

# What are some common mutations of CHRNA5?
 
A variant is a change at a specific point in the gene from the expected nucleotide sequence to another, resulting in incorrect protein function. There are three common variants in CHRNA5: [G1192A (Asp398Asn)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/17497/), [A78573551G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=6495306), and [A78581651T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=7180002).

  <Variant hgvs="NC_000015.10:g.78590583G>A" name="G1192A"> 

    Instead of guanine (G), there is an adenine (A) nucleotide.

  <Genotype hgvs="NC_000008.11:g.[27470994G>A];[27470994=]" name="G1192A"> 

    # What does this mean?
 
    People with this variant have one copy of the [G1192A (Asp398Asn)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/17497/) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    This heterozygous variant affects the brain in a variety of ways. This variant controls [cognitive function, working memory, and gray matter volume in the brain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819610). Males have faster [information processing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25674902), including [better behavioral performance, more efficient cortex activity, and larger gray matter volume](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819610), while women have slower information processing. In general, people have worse [visual cognitive control](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24934182). The brain changes caused by this variant is the [strongest genetic risk factor for developing nicotine dependence in African Americans and Caucasians, with an odds ratio of 1.3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26239294), causes difficulties with smoking cessation, and increases the number of [cigarettes smoked per day](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27344179). People are [15% less likely](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24727484) to be able to quit smoking, and they respond less well to [nicotine replacement therapy(NRT)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28884473). This may be caused due to the variant [increasing the pleasure and mental stimulation experienced after smoking, as well as withdrawal severity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25948103). This variant is also associated with a greater risk for [lung cancer and COPD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27344179).

    # What should I do about this?

    People should not smoke. If you do smoke, be aware of your risk for dependency and increased difficulty of quitting smoking. Consider regular checks for lung cancer.

    [Many factors may decrease your risk of lung cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/types/lung/patient/lung-prevention-pdq#section/all):
    *  Avoid cigarettes, cigars, pipe smoking, and secondhand smoke.
    *  Have less than one alcoholic drink per day.
    *  Practice safe sex, and avoid HIV infection.
    *  Avoid radiation exposure, including atomic bomb radiation, radiation therapy, imaging tests, and radon.
    *  Avoid environmental toxins, such as asbestos, arsenic, chromium, nickel, beryllium, cadmium, tar, soot, and air pollution.
    *  [Beta carotene supplements, made from yellow and orange fruits and vegetables and dark green, leafy vegetables,](https://www.cancer.gov/types/lung/patient/lung-prevention-pdq#section/all) may help reduce risk for heavy smokers.

    [Medications](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P30532#pathology_and_biotech) used for treating CHRNA5 issues include [Ethanol](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00898), [Galantamine](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00674), and [nicotine](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00184).

    People with this variant have two copies of the [G1192A (Asp398Asn)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/17497/) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    This variant controls [cognitive function, working memory, and gray matter volume in the brain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819610). Males have much faster [information processing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25674902), including [much better behavioral performance, more efficient cortex activity, and the largest gray matter volume](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819610), while women have much slower information processing. In general, [visual cognitive control is impaired](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24934182). The brain changes caused by this variant is the [strongest genetic risk factor for developing nicotine dependence in African Americans and Caucasians, with an odds ratio of 1.3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26239294).

This may be caused due to the variant [greatly increasing the pleasure and mental stimulation experienced after smoking, as well as withdrawal severity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25948103). The AA homozygous variant is associated with greatly elevated risk and earlier diagnosis of [lung cancer with an odds ratio of 1.65](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27543155), but not in [Asians](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26434895). It is also associated with [COPD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26771213) and [newborn pulmonary dysfunction and respiratory morbidities](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24838476) in the children of smoking mothers.

    # What should I do about this?

    People should not smoke. If you do smoke, be aware of your risk for dependency and increased difficulty of quitting smoking. Consider regular checks for lung cancer. Pregnant women should consider [supplemental vitamin C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24838476).

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    This variant acts in the brain in the [frontal cortex, temporal cortex, and pons](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26220977), controlling message transmission between the cortex and cerebellum, motor function, problem solving, memory formation and processing, language, judgement, impulse control, and sexual behavior.

    Additionally, it affects the immune system.  Natural killer cells (NKC) are a type of white blood cells found in the blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes.  They kill viral infected cells and tumorous cells.  CFS patients have half the cellular efficiency of the normal population with a [17% cellular death rate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524).  The A78581651T variant may decrease gene expression in both the DNA and RNA, causing significant reduction in NKC activity.  This variant was 2X as common in [CFS patients with an odds ratio of 2.11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524).""

    # What should I do about this?

    People should avoid smoking, and proactively check for lung cancer if they smoke.

    Many dietary supplements have been found to increase or decrease natural killer cell function.
    *  [Resveratrol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4855330/) stimulates the immune system by increasing NKC activity, but sufficient body concentration can only be achieved through supplementation.
    *  [Myricetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075019), a flavonoid found in food and red wine, can increase NKC activity.
    *  [Quercetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19449452), a flavonoid in onions and fruits, may improve NKC and T cell function.
    *  [Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), including suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and valproic acid,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17349632/) impair NKC function, and should be avoided.
