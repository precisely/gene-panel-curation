# What are some common mutations of TRPC2?
 
There is one common variant in TRPC2: [G3628856T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=7108612).

<# G3628856T #>
  <Variant hgvs="NC_000011.10:g.3628856G>T" name="G3628856T"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the TRPC2 gene from guanine (G) to thymine (T) resulting in incorrect protein function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.

  </Variant>

<# G3628856T #>
  <Genotype hgvs="NC_000011.10:g.[3628856G>T];[3628856=]" name="G3628856T"> 

    # What does this mean?
 
    People with this variant have one copy of the [G3628856T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=7108612) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    You are in the Moderate Loss of Function category. See below for more information.

    # What does this mean?

    People with this variant have two copies of the [G3628856T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=7108612) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    This variant is not associated with increased risk.

    # What does this mean?

    Your TRPC2 gene has no variants. A normal gene is referred to as a "wild-type" gene.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    This variant is not associated with increased risk.

# How do changes in TRPC2 affect people?

For the vast majority of people, the overall risk associated with the common TRPC2 variants is small and does not impact treatment. It is possible that variants in this gene interact with other gene variants, which is the reason for our inclusion of this gene.
