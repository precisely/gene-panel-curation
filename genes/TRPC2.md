# What does the TRPC2 gene do?

TPRC [(transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily C, member 2)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7221) is a pseudogene, or partially functional gene found in other species such as mouse and monkey, that encodes a protein. This may help form [permeable calcium cation channels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17517433) that are active in [neurons and sperm cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17217050). These pathways are activated by pheromones and moderate [aggression and the immune system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17217050). Variants have been linked to [ME/CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524) due to impaired natural killer cell activity.

This gene is located on chromosome 11. The protein it creates acts in your bone marrow and lungs.

# How do changes in TRPC2 affect people?

For the vast majority of people, the overall risk associated with the common TRPC2 variants is small and does not impact treatment. It is possible that variants in this gene interact with other gene variants, which is the reason for our inclusion of this gene.

# Moderate Risk

Natural killer cells (NKC) are a type of white blood cells found in the blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes. They kill viral infected cells and tumorous cells. Many patients with ME/CFS have NK cells with lower functional ability to fight infections, and [this impairment is associated with illness severity](https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/about/possible-causes.html). Compared with the general population, CFS patients have half the cellular efficiency with a [17% cellular death rate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524). In people, TRPC2 is considered a pseudogene, which is a segment of DNA that has lost some functionality due to loss of segments. Also known as “junk DNA,” pseudogenes may perform some regulatory functions and contain evolutionary histories. 
The following variants may be related to a decrease gene expression in both the DNA and RNA, causing significant reduction in NKC activity.
- [G3628856T (G;T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524) is [3.76X] more common in CFS patients. 
- [G3638061A (A;A)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524) is [1.9X] more common in CFS patients.

# What should I do about this?

Some pharmaceuticals may increase or decrease natural killer cell function:
- [Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), including suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and valproic acid,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17349632/) impair NKC function and should be avoided. 
- [Acyclovir, ganciclovir, and related prophylactic antiviral drugs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353) may improve cellular function. 
- [Therapies for papillomaviruses, topical agents, physical approaches and immunostimulants,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353) may activate NK cells. 
- [Cytokine therapies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353), such as [IFN-α](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/bio-therapies-fact-sheet) in CNKD1, may induce higher levels of NKC cytotoxic activity by [activating white blood cells](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/bio-therapies-fact-sheet). 

Many dietary supplements have been found to increase natural killer cell function:
- [Resveratrol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4855330/) stimulates the immune system by increasing NKC activity, but sufficient body concentration can only be achieved through supplementation. 
- [Myricetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075019), a flavonoid found in food and red wine, can increase NKC activity. 
- [Quercetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19449452), a flavonoid in onions and fruits, may improve NKC and T cell function. 
- [Bulgarian yogurt fermented with L. delbrueckii ssp. Bulgaricus augments NKC activity.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26686726) 
- [Zinc](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27021581) helps to improve immune system activity and response. 
- [Inositol hexaphosphate (IP6), found in germ, bran, and whole kernel corn](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11366552) may activate the immune system and help fight bacterial and fungal infections. 
- [Arabinoxylan rice bran (MGN-3/Biobran](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25541298) increases activation and stimulates cell killing activity.
