# What does the GRIK2 gene do?

GRIK2 (glutamate ionotropic receptor kainate type subunit 2) encodes a glutamate receptor in the brain. When L-glutamate binds to these receptors, it opens electrical ion channels to pass messages in the brain. These receptors may be involved in learning, memory, neuroplasticity, and eyesight. Variants may be related to mental retardation, cognitive disability, OCD severity, suicidal thoughts, and ME/CFS.

This gene is located on chromosome 6. The protein it creates acts in your brain and heart.

# What are some common mutations of GRIK2?
 
There is one common variant in GRIK2: [A101518578G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=2247215).

<# A101518578G #>
  <Variant hgvs="NC_000006.12:g.101518578A>G" name="A101518578G"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the GRIK2 gene from adenine (A) to guanine (G) resulting in incorrect protein function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.

  <Genotype hgvs="NC_000006.12:g.[101518578A>G];[101518578=]" name="A101518578G"> 

    # What does this mean?
 
    People with this variant have one copy of the [A101518578G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=2247215) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    Your G variant causes a 10-fold decrease in GRIK2 expression and may lead to improper glutamate receptor creation, causing cognitive and eyesight problems. Your variant has been linked to increased OCD severity and is located in the same section of the gene linked to suicidal thoughts. 50% of ME/CFS patients have the G variant as compared to 24% of healthy patients. This variant may also be linked with the C variant of rs2247218, but further research is needed to determine the exact connection between the two variants and ME/CFS.

    # What should I do about this?

    Be aware of and monitor your mood for signs of depression. If you experience problems with thinking and memory, consider learning new skills and being active to increase your “cognitive reserve.” You may also consider formal cognitive training such as memory training, reasoning training, or processing–speed training. 

    Medications linked to GRIK2 include Amobarbital, Aprobarbital, Barbital, Barbituric acid derivative, Butabarbital, Butalbital, Butethal, Domoic Acid, Heptabarbital, Hexobarbital, L-Glutamic Acid, Metharbital, Methylphenobarbital, Pentobarbital, Phenobarbital, Primidone, Quisqualate, Secobarbital, Talbutal, and Thiopental.
