# What are some common mutations of GRIK2?
 
There is one common variant in GRIK2: [A101518578G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=2247215).

<# A101518578G #>
  <Variant hgvs="NC_000006.12:g.101518578A>G" name="A101518578G"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the GRIK2 gene from adenine (A) to guanine (G) resulting in incorrect protein function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.

    # What does this mean?
 
    People with this variant have one copy of the [A101518578G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=2247215) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    You are in the Moderate Loss of Function category. See below for more information.

    # What does this mean?

    People with this variant have two copies of the [A101518578G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=2247215) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    You are in the Severe Loss of Function category. See below for more information.

    # What does this mean?

    Your GRIK2 gene has no variants. A normal gene is referred to as a "wild-type" gene.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    This variant is not associated with increased risk.

    # What does this mean?

    Your GRIK2 gene has no variants. A normal gene is referred to as a "wild-type" gene.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    Your variant is not associated with any loss of function.

# How do changes in GRIK2 affect people?

For the vast majority of people, the overall risk associated with the common GRIK2 variants is small and does not impact treatment. It is possible that variants in this gene interact with other gene variants, which is the reason for our inclusion of this gene.
