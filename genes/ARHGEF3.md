# What are some common mutations of ARHGEF3?
 
There is one well-known variant in ARHGEF3: [G56871895A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=6445832).

<# G56871895A #>
 <Variant hgvs="NC_000003.12:g.56871895G>A" name="G56871895A"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the ARHGEF3 gene from guanine (G) to adenine (A) resulting in incorrect protein function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.
 
</Variant>

<# G56871895A #>
 <Genotype hgvs="NC_000003.12:g.[56871895G>A];[56871895=]" name="G56871895A"> 

     # What does this mean?
 
     People with this variant have one copy of the [G56871895A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=6445832) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.
       
     # What is the effect of this variant?

     This variant is not associated with increased risk.

     # How common is this genotype in the general population?

     # What does this mean?

     Your ARHGEF3 gene has no variants. A normal gene is referred to as a "wild-type" gene.

     # What is the effect of this variant?

     This variant is not associated with increased risk.

     # How common is this genotype in the general population?
