# What are some common mutations of UBAC2?
 
There are two well-known variants in UBAC2: [A91754952AG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=12312259) and [A99394905T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=9585049).

<# A91754952AG #>
 <Variant hgvs="CM000674.2:g.91754952A>G" name="A91754952AG"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the UBAC2 gene from adenine (A) to guanine (G) resulting in incorrect  function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.
 
</Variant>
<# A99394905T #>
 <Variant hgvs="CM000675.2:g.99394905A>T" name="A99394905T"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the UBAC2 gene from adenine (A) to thymine (T) resulting in incorrect  function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.
