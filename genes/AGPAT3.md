# What are some common mutations of AGPAT3?
 
There is one well-known variant in AGPAT3: [A43928298C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=3788079).

<# A43928298C #>
 <Variant hgvs="NC_000021.9:g.43928298A>C" name="A43928298C"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the AGPAT3 gene from adenine (A) to cytosine (C) resulting in incorrect protein function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.
