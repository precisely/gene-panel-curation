# What are some common mutations of NPAS2?
 
There is one common variant in NPAS2: [G100923328A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=356653).

<# G100923328A #>
  <Variant hgvs="NC_000002.12:g.100923328G>A" name="G100923328A"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the NPAS2 gene from cytosine (C) to thymine (T) resulting in incorrect protein function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.

    # What does this mean?
 
    People with this variant have one copy of the [G100923328A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=356653) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    You are in the Moderate Loss of Function category. See below for more information.

    # What does this mean?

    Your NPAS2 gene has no variants. A normal gene is referred to as a "wild-type" gene.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    This variant is not associated with increased risk.

    # What does this mean?

    Your NPAS2 gene has no variants. A normal gene is referred to as a "wild-type" gene.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    Your variant is not associated with any loss of function.

# How do changes in NPAS2 affect people?

For the vast majority of people, the overall risk associated with the common NPAS2 variants is small and does not impact treatment. It is possible that variants in this gene interact with other gene variants, which is the reason for our inclusion of this gene.
