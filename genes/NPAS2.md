# What does the NPAS2 gene do?

NPAS2 (Neuronal PAS domain-containing protein 2) encodes a protein that helps bind RNA to DNA to begin transcription, or expression, of the gene. This protein is a core component of the 24-hour circadian clock in the brain, which may be controlled through light, neurological, and hormonal cues. NPAS2 synchronizes hunger with food availability, maintains sleep/wake cycles due to light interactions in the retina, and helps regulate cell cycles in the liver that repair DNA.  Disruptions in the circadian rhythm may contribute to cardiovascular disease, cancer, metabolic syndrome, and aging. Variants in NPAS2 are associated with major depressive disorder, seasonal affective disorder, and ME/CFS.

This gene is located on chromosome 2. The protein it creates acts in your esophagus and bladder.

# What are some common mutations of NPAS2?
 
There is one common variant in NPAS2: [G100923328A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=356653).

<# G100923328A #>
  <Variant hgvs="NC_000002.12:g.100923328G>A" name="G100923328A"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the NPAS2 gene from cytosine (C) to thymine (T) resulting in incorrect protein function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.

<# G100923328A #>
  <Genotype hgvs="NC_000002.12:g.[100923328G>A];[100923328=]" name="G100923328A"> 

    # What does this mean?
 
    People with this variant have one copy of the [G100923328A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=356653) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    NPAS2 variants may be linked to sleep problems, metabolic imbalances, and mood disorders in ME/CFS patients due to disrupted circadian rhythms.  Your T allele is 1.9X more common in ME/CFS patients compared to the normal population, and it causes a 10-fold increase in NPAS2 gene expression. This may disrupt hunger cues and sleep cycles, causing impaired cued and contextual memory, depression, or seasonal affective disorder. 

    # What should I do about this?

    Patients should monitor their dietary intake and hunger cues to maintain weight.
    
    Lifestyle changes to help with circadian rhythm disruption sleep problems may include:
    - Go to bed the same time every night.
    - Do not nap in the daytime or spend time in bed during the day.
    - Minimize light and sound in your bedroom, including television, computers, and cell phones.
    - Work fewer night and evening shifts.
    - Walk or exercise 30 minutes most days.
    - Minimize alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, and cold medications.
    - Properly treat any bipolar, depression, anxiety, or other mood disorders.

    Medications to aid sleep include Zolpidem (Ambien), Zaleplon (Sonata), Eszoicolone (Lunesta), Ramelteon (Rozerem), and antihistamines.  Consult your doctor.
