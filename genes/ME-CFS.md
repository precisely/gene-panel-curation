# What is ME/CFS?		

Myalgic Encephalopathy Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a mysterious condition where overwhelming fatigue prevents people from doing their normal, daily activities. This fatigue is not improved by rest and is worsened by exertion. It’s important to note that sufferers of ME/CFS may not appear ill.

<# Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a disabling and complex illness. People with ME/CFS may not look ill, but they are often not able to do their usual activities and may be confined to bed. People have overwhelming fatigue that is not improved by rest and symptoms that may get worse after activity. Anyone can get ME/CFS. While most common in people between 40 and 60 years old, the illness affects children, adolescents, and adults of all ages. #>
					
# What causes ME/CFS?

[Doctors don't know what causes ME/CFS](), so patients are diagnosed based on their symptoms and medical history. For many people, symptoms start after a viral illness. In some cases, it seems to follow a major physical or emotional trauma or exposure to toxins. In addition, it is possible that two or more triggers might work together to cause the illness. There is no single known cause of ME/CFS.	

<# Researchers have not yet found what causes ME/CFS, and there are no specific laboratory tests to diagnose ME/CFS directly. Therefore, doctors need to consider the diagnosis of ME/CFS based on in-depth evaluation of a person’s symptoms and medical history. It is also important that doctors diagnose and treat any other conditions that can cause similar symptoms. Even though there is no cure for ME/CFS, some symptoms can be treated or managed. #>

# What treatments are available?		

Since there is not yet a cure for chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), the key to living with ME/CFS is treating the most problematic symptoms. [Medications](https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/treatment/index.html) for pain, sleep, depression, anxiety, or ADHD may be used to treat certain ME/CFS symptoms. If necessary, patients may be referred to counselors, pain specialists, and dieticians. Doctors may also suggest lifestyle changes, such as [activity pacing and better sleep hygiene](https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/treatment/index.html). At home, patients may try [yoga, meditation, deep breathing, or relaxation exercises](https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/treatment/index.html).

<# There is no cure or approved treatment for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). However, some symptoms can be treated or managed. Treating these symptoms might provide relief for some patients with ME/CFS but not others. Other strategies, like learning new ways to manage activity, can also be helpful.
Patients, their families, and healthcare providers need to work together to decide which symptom causes the most problems. This should be treated first. Patients, families, and healthcare providers should discuss the possible benefits and harms of any treatment plans, including medicines and other therapies.
Healthcare providers need to support their patients’ families as they come to understand how to live with this illness. Providers and families should remember that this process might be hard on people with ME/CFS.
activity management, also called pacing. The goal of pacing is to learn to balance rest and activity to avoid PEM flare-ups, which can be caused by exertion that patients with ME/CFS cannot tolerate. 
Good sleep habits are important for all people, including those with ME/CFS. When people try these tips but are still unable to sleep, their doctor might recommend taking medicine to help with sleep. 
Doctors may first recommend trying over-the-counter pain-relievers, like acetaminophen, aspirin, or ibuprofen. If these do not provide enough pain relief, patients may need to see a pain specialist. 
When present, depression or anxiety should be treated. Although treating depression or anxiety can be helpful, it is not a cure for ME/CFS.
Some people with ME/CFS might benefit from antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications
or people with ME/CFS who have concentration problems, some doctors have prescribed stimulant medications, like those typically used to treat Attention-Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). While stimulants might help improve concentration for some patients with ME/CFS,
 
Strategies that do not involve use of medications and might be helpful to some patients are:
Professional counseling: Talking with a therapist to help find strategies to cope with the illness and its impact on daily life and relationships.
Balanced diet. A balanced diet is important for everyone’s good health and would benefit a person with or without any chronic illness.
Nutritional supplements. Doctors might run tests to see if patients lack any important nutrients and might suggest supplements to try. Doctors and patients should talk about any risks and benefits of supplements, and consider any possible interactions that may occur with prescription medications. Follow-up tests to see if nutrient levels improve can help with treatment planning.
Complementary therapies. Therapies, like meditation, gentle massage, deep breathing, or relaxation therapy, might be helpful.
