# What does the IFNG gene do?

IFNG [(Interferon gamma)](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P01579) encodes a cytokine, also known as a small protein, that is involved in cell signaling and immunomodulating. The INF-gamma cytokine is produced by lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) when activated by antigens such as viruses or microbial infections. It has antiviral properties, immunoregulatory functions, and antitumor effects. Variations in this gene are associated with autoimmune disorders including [systemic lupus erythematosus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19919944), [increased susceptibility to viral, bacterial, and parasitical infections](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3458) such as [tuberculosis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24529854), [asthma](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18385742), [aplastic anemia](http://www.uniprot.org/citations/15327519), [increased progression of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12854077) and [ME/CFS]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26063326).

This gene is located on chromosome 12. The protein it creates acts in your bone marrow and lymph nodes.

# What are some common mutations of IFNG?
 
There are two common variants in IFNG: [A68156382G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=2069718) and [G-179T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/14724/).

# How do changes in IFNG affect people?

For the vast majority of people, the overall risk associated with the common IFNG variants is small and does not impact treatment. It is possible that variants in this gene interact with other gene variants, which is the reason for our inclusion of this gene.

# Moderate Risk

This variant causes increased IFN-gamma production in natural killer cells and T-cells, which decreases CD-4 counts and impairs the ability of the immune system to recognize and fight viruses. Elevated expression of IFNG has been associated with [systemic lupus erythematosus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19919944), with this variant being marginally correlated. Due to the reduced efficiency of the immune system, The CT and TT variants significantly associated with [tuberculosis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24529854),  [pulmonary tuberculosis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28867622), [asthma](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18385742) and [ME/CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26063326).

# What should I do about this?

People should consider regular bloodwork to check levels of white blood cells. Be aware of your susceptibility to TB and avoid infectious areas and patients.  [Medications](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P01579) used for IFNG variants include: [Apremilast](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB05676), [Fontolizumab](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB05111), [Glucosamine](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01296), [Olsalazine](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01250), and [VIR201](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB05110).

# Moderate Risk

This pathogenic, or disease causing variant, is associated with [rapid progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/C4016227).  The -179T allele is a risk factor, as IFN-gamma production is increased, causing CD4 cell depletion. This reduction weakens the immune system and [hastens the onset of AIDS after infection with HIV](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16724074).

# What should I do about this?

People who are HIV positive should carefully monitor CD4 levels.
