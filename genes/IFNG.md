# What are some common mutations of IFNG?
 
There are two common variants in IFNG: [A68156382G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=2069718) and [G-179T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/14724/).

<# A68156382G #>
  <Variant hgvs="NC_000012.12:g.68156382A>G" name="A68156382G"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the IFNG gene from adenine (A) to guanine (G) resulting in incorrect protein function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.

  </Variant>
<# G-179T #>
  <Variant hgvs="NC_000005.10:g.40831840C>T" name="G-179T"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the IFNG gene from cytosine (C) to thymine (T) resulting in incorrect protein function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.

    # What does this mean?
 
    People with this variant have one copy of the [A68156382G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=2069718) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    This variant is not associated with increased risk.

# How do changes in IFNG affect people?

For the vast majority of people, the overall risk associated with the common IFNG variants is small and does not impact treatment. It is possible that variants in this gene interact with other gene variants, which is the reason for our inclusion of this gene.
