# What are some common mutations of POMC?
 
There are five common variants in POMC: [T25164312G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=12473543), [T25161964C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=6713532), [A25166355G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=934778), [A133-2C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/436364/), and [20_21insGGGCCCTCGGGGGCCCCTCGGGTGG (p.Ser7Argfs)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/520619/).

# How do changes in POMC affect people?

For the vast majority of people, the overall risk associated with the common POMC variants is small and does not impact treatment. It is possible that variants in this gene interact with other gene variants, which is the reason for our inclusion of this gene.
