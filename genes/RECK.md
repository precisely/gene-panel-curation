# What are some common mutations of RECK?
 
There are two well-known variants in RECK: [G36091133A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=12235235) and [T119856753C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=7849492).

<# G36091133A #>
 <Variant hgvs="NC_000009.11:g.36091133G>A" name="G36091133A"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the RECK gene from guanine (G) to adenine (A) resulting in incorrect protein function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.
 
</Variant>
<# T119856753C #>
 <Variant hgvs="CM000671.2:g.119856753T>C" name="T119856753C"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the RECK gene from thymine (T) to cytosine (C) resulting in incorrect protein function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.

     # What does this mean?
 
     People with this variant have one copy of the [G36091133A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=12235235) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

     # What is the effect of this variant?

     You are in the Moderate Loss of Function category. See below for more information.
