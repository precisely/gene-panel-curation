# What are some common mutations of PEX16?
 
There is one well-known variant in PEX16: [C542-16T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/259546/).

<# C542-16T #>
 <Variant hgvs="NC_000011.10:g.45914484G>A" name="C542-16T"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the PEX16 gene from cytosine (C) to thymine (T) resulting in incorrect protien function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.
 
</Variant>

<# C542-16T #>
 <Genotype hgvs="NC_000011.10:g.[45914484G>A];[45914484=]" name="C542-16T"> 

     # What does this mean?
 
     People with this variant have one copy of the [C542-16T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/259546/) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

     # What is the effect of this variant?

     You are in the Mild Loss of Function category. See below for more information.

     # What does this mean?

     Your PEX16 gene has no variants. A normal gene is referred to as a "wild-type" gene.

     # What is the effect of this variant?

     This variant is not associated with increased risk.

     # How common is this genotype in the general population?

 <piechart percentage=57.8 />
