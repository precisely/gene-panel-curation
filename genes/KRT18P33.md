# What are some common mutations of KRT18P33?
 
There is one well-known variant in KRT18P33: [C231342446T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=16827966).

<# C231342446T #>
 <Variant hgvs="NC_000002.12:g.231342446C>T" name="C231342446T"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the KRT18P33 gene from cytosine (C) to thymine (T) resulting in incorrect pseudogene function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.
 
</Variant>

<# C231342446T #>
 <Genotype hgvs="NC_000002.12:g.[231342446C>T];[231342446=]" name="C231342446T"> 

     # What does this mean?
 
     People with this variant have one copy of the [C231342446T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=16827966) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

     # What is the effect of this variant?

     Your variant is not associated with any loss of function.

     # How common is this genotype in the general population?

     # What does this mean?

     People with this variant have two copies of the [C231342446T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=16827966) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

     # What is the effect of this variant?

     You are in the Moderate Loss of Function category. See below for more information.
