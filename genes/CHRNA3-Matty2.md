# What does the CHRNA3 gene do?

CHRNA3 (Neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-3) encodes a nicotine neurotransmitter receptor protein called [acetylcholine](http://www.uniprot.org/citations/8906617) that regulates nicotine dependence and nicotine receptor proliferation and destruction. It also controls [ion](http://www.uniprot.org/citations/20438829) and [serotonin](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/term/GO:0022850) channels in the brain.  Variants in this gene have been associated with [nicotine dependence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22290489), increased daily [cigarette consumption](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23870182), [lung cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19836008), [COPD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621683), [cocaine dependence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20485328), and [ME/CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524). 

This gene is located on chromosome 15. The protein it creates acts in your brain, nervous system, and immune system.

<# Effects #>

<source name="Mild-C78606381T">

For the vast majority of people, the overall risk associated with the common CHRNA3 variants is small and does not impact treatment. It is possible that variants in this gene interact with other gene variants, which is the reason for our inclusion of this gene.

Incorrect formation of the CHRNA3 nicotine neurotransmitter receptor protein has a variety of effects. This heterozygous variant causes increased risk of [lung cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23094028), with an [odds ratio of 1.2]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28827732), and [COPD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621683), with an [odds ratio of 1.39](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621683). It causes an [increase](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29030599) of [one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21559498) [cigarette](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23870182) [per day](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20418890) and may also cause [smoking persistence]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22290489). However, the C allele is protective, with a [decrease of 3.25 packs per year per C allele](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21436384). Finally, this variant may cause an increase in [cocaine dependence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20485328).

# What should I do about this?

People also should not smoke or use cocaine. If you do smoke, be aware of your risk for dependency and increased difficulty of quitting smoking.

[Many factors may decrease your risk of lung cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/types/lung/patient/lung-prevention-pdq#section/all):
*  Avoid cigarettes, cigars, pipe smoking, and secondhand smoke.
*  Have less than one alcoholic drink per day.
*  Practice safe sex, and avoid HIV infection.
*  Avoid radiation exposure, including atomic bomb radiation, radiation therapy, imaging tests, and radon.
*  Avoid environmental toxins, such as asbestos, arsenic, chromium, nickel, beryllium, cadmium, tar, soot, and air pollution.
*  [Beta carotene supplements, made from yellow and orange fruits and vegetables and dark green, leafy vegetables,](https://www.cancer.gov/types/lung/patient/lung-prevention-pdq#section/all) may help reduce risk for heavy smokers.

[Medications](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P32297) indicated for use for CHRNA3 issues include: [Bupropion](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01156), [Cytisine](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB09028), [Dextromethorphan](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00514), [Ethanol](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00898), [Galantamine](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00674), [Levamisole](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00848), [Levomethadyl Acetate](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01227), [Nicotine](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00184), [Pentolinium](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01090), and [Varenicline](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01273).

This homozygous variant causes a greatly increased risk of [lung cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23094028), with an [odds ratio of 1.44](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21559498), and [COPD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621683), with an [odds ratio of 1.39](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621683).   It also causes an [increase](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29030599) of [two](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21559498) [cigarettes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23870182) [smoked per day](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20418890) and may also cause greatly increased [smoking persistence]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22290489).

Natural killer cells (NKC) are a type of white blood cells found in the blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes. They kill viral infected cells and tumorous cells. CFS patients have half the cellular efficiency of the normal population with a [17% cellular death
rate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524). The C78606381T (T;T) variant decreases gene expression in both the DNA and RNA, causing significant reduction in NKC activity. This variant was five times as common in [CFS patients at 85.7% with an odds ratio of 6.22.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524)

Many dietary supplements have been found to increase or decrease natural killer cell function.
*  [Resveratrol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4855330/) stimulates the immune system by increasing NKC activity, but
  sufficient body concentration can only be achieved through supplementation.
*  [Myricetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075019), a flavonoid found in food and red wine, can increase NKC activity.
*  [Quercetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19449452), a flavonoid in onions and fruits, may improve NKC and T cell function.
*  [Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), including suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and valproic acid,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17349632/) impair NKC function, and should be avoided.
