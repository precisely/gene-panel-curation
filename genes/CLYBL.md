# What does the CLYBL gene do?

CLYBL ([Citramalyl-CoA lyase, mitochondrial](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q8N0X4#pathology_and_biotech)) creates a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the vitamin B12 metabolism.  It also mediates magnesium ion and metal binding and malate synthase. Vitamins B12 (cobalamin) plays a fundamental role as a cofactor in several metabolic pathways, including [detoxification](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19409980) due to its substantial [antioxidant] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19799418) properties.  Vitamin B12 deficiency is linked with [pernicious anemia, neurodegenerative disorder, cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal disease]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22367966), and [ME/CFS]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29100069).

This gene is located on chromosome 13.  The mitochondrial enzyme it creates acts in your [kidney, liver](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/171425#gene-expression), and blood.

 # What are some common mutations of CLYBL?
 
There are 1 well known variant in CLYBL: [C775T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29100069) (Arg259Ter).
<# C775T #>
  <Variant hgvs="NC_000013.11:g.99866380C>T" name="C775T"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the CLYBL gene from cytosine (C) to thymine (T) resulting in incorrect mitochondrial enzyme function.  This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.

         People with this variant have one copy of the [C775T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29100069) (Arg259Ter) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

         # What is the effect of this variant?

         You are in the Mild Loss of Function category. See below for more information.

         People with this variant have two copies of the [C775T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29100069) (Arg259Ter) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

         # What is the effect of this variant?

         # What does this mean?

         Your CLYBL gene has no variants. A normal gene is referred to as a "wildtype" gene.

         # What is the effect of this variant?

         Your variant is not associated with any loss of function.

         # How common is this genotype in the general population?

         # What does this mean?

         Your CLYBL gene has no variants. A normal gene is referred to as a "wildtype" gene.

         # What is the effect of this variant?

         This variant is not associated with increased risk.

# How do changes in CLYBL affect people?

For the vast majority of people, the overall risk associated with the common CLYBL variants is small, and do not impact treatment. It is possible that variants in this gene interact with other gene variants, which is the reason for our inclusion of this gene in the gene panel.

<# C775T (C:T) #>

# Mild Loss of Function

This variant causes an [amino acid change](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22367966) in the protein and causes it to stop prematurely.  The protein may then may bind incorrectly with ions and metals, leading to [malabsorption of B12 and mental fatigue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009).  People with this variant have serum vitamin B12 levels [88.9% lower](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22367966) than normal and may have higher homocysteine levels.  This variant is also more common in people with [ME/CFS]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29100069).

# What should I do about this?

* Check serum vitamin B12 levels, and consider an [oral or injectable B12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009) supplement if low.
* Be cautious when taking [opioids, duloxetine, pregabalin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009), and [metformin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20488910?dopt=Abstract), which lower B12 levels.

<# C775T (T:T) #>

# Severe Loss of Function

This variant causes an [amino acid change](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22367966) in the citrate lyase beta-like protein encoded by CLYBL, causing it to stop very prematurely.  The protein may then bind incorrectly with ions and metals, leading to [malabsorption of B12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009).  People with this variant have serum vitamin B12 levels [36.2% lower](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22367966) than normal.  Vitamin B12 deficiency is linked to [anemia, loss of balance, numbness or tingling in the arms and legs, and weakness](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002403.htm).  The reduction of circulating vitamin B12 also causes increased levels of [itaconate]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29056341), an anti-microbial metabolite and immunomodulator, which in turn deactivates vitamin B12.  

This variant is much more common in people with [ME/CFS]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29100069).  In ME/CFS, [hypomethylation](http://dx.doi.org/10.4172/2155-9899.1000228), which is greatly affected by the vitamins B12 and folate (B9), is seen in a majority of certain [immune cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25111603/).  The low B12 causes high homocysteine levels, which correlate significantly with [coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, hardening of the arteries](https://labtestsonline.org/tests/homocysteine), and [mental fatigue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009), suggesting a blockage of B12 across the blood brain barrier.

# What should I do about this?

* Consider a daily [oral folic acid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009) supplement combined with oral or injectable B12.
* Avoid [opioids, duloxetine, pregabalin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009), [metformin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20488910?dopt=Abstract), and other drugs that have to be demethylated.
* Check homocysteine levels, and consider taking [folate](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/1017.html) if elevated.
* Watch for eye lens dislocations, unusual (Marfan type) body shape, stroke, blood clotting abnormalities, and low thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism).
