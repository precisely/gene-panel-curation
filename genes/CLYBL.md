# What does the CLYBL gene do?

CLYBL ([Citramalyl-CoA lyase, mitochondrial)](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q8N0X4#pathology_and_biotech) creates a mitochondrial enzyme involved  in the metabolism of vitamin B12 (cobalamin). It also mediates magnesium ion and metal binding and malate synthase. Vitamin B12 plays a fundamental role as a cofactor in several metabolic pathways, including [detoxification](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19409980) due to its substantial [antioxidant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19799418) properties. Vitamin B12 deficiency is linked to [pernicious anemia, neurodegenerative disorder, cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22367966), and [ME/CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29100069).

This gene is located on chromosome 13. The mitochondrial enzyme it creates acts in your [kidney, liver](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/171425#gene-expression), and blood.

# What are some common mutations of CLYBL?
 
There is one well-known variant in CLYBL: [C775T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29100069) (Arg259Ter).

<# C775T #>
  <Variant hgvs="NC_000013.11:g.99866380C>T" name="C775T"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the CLYBL gene from cytosine (C) to thymine (T) resulting in incorrect mitochondrial enzyme function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.

    # What does this mean?

    Your CLYBL gene has no variants. A normal gene is referred to as a "wild-type" gene.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    Your variant is not associated with any loss of function.

# How do changes in CLYBL affect people?

For the vast majority of people, the overall risk associated with the common CLYBL variants is small and does not impact treatment. It is possible that variants in this gene interact with other gene variants, which is the reason for our inclusion of this gene.

# Mild Loss of Function

This variant [changes an amino acid in the protein](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22367966), which causes the length to be prematurely truncated. The protein may then may bind incorrectly with ions and metals, leading to [malabsorption of vitamin B12 and mental fatigue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009). People with this variant have serum vitamin B12 levels [88.9% lower](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22367966) than normal and may have higher homocysteine levels. This variant is also more common in people with [ME/CFS]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29100069).

# What should I do about this?

* Check serum vitamin B12 levels, and consider an [oral or injectable B12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009) supplement if low.
* Be cautious when taking [opioids, duloxetine, pregabalin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009), and [metformin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20488910?dopt=Abstract), which lower B12 levels.

# Severe Loss of Function

This variant causes an [amino acid change](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22367966) in the citrate lyase beta-like protein encoded by CLYBL, causing the protien length to be truncated very prematurely. The protein may then bind incorrectly with ions and metals, leading to [malabsorption of B12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009). People with this variant have serum vitamin B12 levels [36.2% lower](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22367966) than normal. Vitamin B12 deficiency is linked to [anemia, loss of balance, numbness or tingling in the arms and legs, and weakness](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002403.htm). The reduction of circulating vitamin B12 also causes increased levels of [itaconate]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29056341), an anti-microbial metabolite and immunomodulator, which in turn deactivates vitamin B12. 

This variant is much more common in people with [ME/CFS]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29100069). In ME/CFS, [hypomethylation](http://dx.doi.org/10.4172/2155-9899.1000228), which is greatly affected by the vitamins B12 and folate (B9), is seen in a majority of certain [immune cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25111603/). The low B12 causes high homocysteine levels, which correlate significantly with [coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, hardening of the arteries](https://labtestsonline.org/tests/homocysteine), and [mental fatigue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009), suggesting a blockage of B12 across the blood brain barrier.

# What should I do about this?

* Consider a daily [oral folic acid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009) supplement combined with oral or injectable B12.
* Avoid [opioids, duloxetine, pregabalin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902009), [metformin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20488910?dopt=Abstract), and other anti-epilectic drugs.
* Check homocysteine levels, and consider taking [folate](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/1017.html) if elevated.
* Watch for eye lens dislocations, unusual (Marfan type) body shape, stroke, blood clotting abnormalities, and low thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism).
