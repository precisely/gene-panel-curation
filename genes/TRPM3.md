# What does the TRPM3 gene do?

TRPM3 (transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 3) controls [calcium channels](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9HCF6#expression)

This gene is located on chromosome 9. The protein it creates acts in your brain and kidneys.

# How do changes in TRPM3 affect people?

For the vast majority of people, the overall risk associated with the common TRPM3 variants is small and does not impact treatment. It is possible that variants in this gene interact with other gene variants, which is the reason for our inclusion of this gene.
