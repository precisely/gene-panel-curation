# What does the TRPM3 gene do?

TRPM3 (transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 3) controls [calcium channels](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9HCF6#expression). These channels help to detect temperature and pain to maintain homeostasis in the body, and incorrect function may lead to [generalized pain and central nervous system impairments](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10067-006-0433-9). Linked health issues include [cataracts, glaucoma](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-54215-2_17), [inflammatory pain syndromes, rheumatoid arthritis, and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines](http://jme.endocrinology-journals.org/content/50/3/R75.short). In ME/CFS patients, variants may be linked to [insulin and glucose dysregulation](http://jme.endocrinology-journals.org/content/50/3/R75.short), [multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.4137/III.S25147), [problems maintaining body temperature](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/120/1/e129.short), and [impaired natural killer cell (NKC) function, which may lead to increased inflammation and illness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27245705).

This gene is located on chromosome 9. The protein it creates acts in your brain and kidneys.

# How do changes in TRPM3 affect people?

For the vast majority of people, the overall risk associated with the common TRPM3 variants is small and does not impact treatment. It is possible that variants in this gene interact with other gene variants, which is the reason for our inclusion of this gene.

# Moderate Risk

Natural killer cells (NKC) are a type of white blood cells found in the blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes. They kill viral infected cells and tumorous cells. Many patients with ME/CFS have NK cells with lower functional ability to fight infections, and [this impairment is associated with illness severity](https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/about/possible-causes.html). Compared with the general population, CFS patients have half the cellular efficiency with a [17% cellular death rate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524). In CFS patients, TRPM3 variants cause [incorrect cell surface expression in NKC, as well as decreased intracellular calcium](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27245705).

The following variants decrease gene expression in both the DNA and RNA, causing significant reduction in NKC activity.

# What should I do about this?

Some pharmaceuticals may increase or decrease natural killer cell function:

- [Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), including suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and valproic acid,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17349632/) impair NKC function and should be avoided. 
- [Acyclovir, ganciclovir, and related prophylactic antiviral drugs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353) may improve cellular function. 
- [Therapies for papillomaviruses, topical agents, physical approaches and immunostimulants,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353) may activate NK cells. 
- [Cytokine therapies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353), such as [IFN-α](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/bio-therapies-fact-sheet) in CNKD1, may induce higher levels of NKC cytotoxic activity by [activating white blood cells](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/bio-therapies-fact-sheet). 
- Consider the [HPV vaccine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353) as issues with natural killer cells cause higher susceptibility. 

Many dietary supplements have been found to increase natural killer cell function:

- [Resveratrol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4855330/) stimulates the immune system by increasing NKC activity, but sufficient body concentration can only be achieved through supplementation. 
- [Myricetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075019), a flavonoid found in food and red wine, can increase NKC activity. 
- [Quercetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19449452), a flavonoid in onions and fruits, may improve NKC and T cell function. 
- [Bulgarian yogurt fermented with L. delbrueckii ssp. Bulgaricus augments NKC activity.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26686726) 
- [Zinc](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27021581) helps to improve immune system activity and response. 
- [Inositol hexaphosphate (IP6), found in germ, bran, and whole kernel corn](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11366552) may activate the immune system and help fight bacterial and fungal infections. 
- [Arabinoxylan rice bran (MGN-3/Biobran](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25541298) increases activation and stimulates cell killing activity.

# Moderate Risk

Calcium mobilization into white blood cells is reduced by the A70822908G (A;G) variant, which may cause increased immune system dysfunction, such as improper development of antibodies and increased symptom severity. This variant is [2.2X](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27834303) more common in CFS patients compared to the general population.

# What should I do about this?

[Anti-CD20 intervention](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27834303) may help CFS patients, and has shown to increase muscarinic antibody positivity and reduced symptoms.

# Moderate Risk

Biological processes responsible for the varied symptoms reported for [ME/CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27835969) may involve ion channels and receptors that are located on cells throughout the body. These channels maintain homeostasis, and incorrect function has been linked to [chronic pain, overactive bladder, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiac hypertrophy, familial Alzheimer’s disease, skin diseases, neuropathy, and cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27835969). In CFS patients, TRP channels are targeted during inflammatory reactions, and may play a role in [multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.4137/III.S25147).

TRPM3 channels transport calcium and zinc and incorrect function has been linked to [cataracts, glaucoma](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-54215-2_17), inflammatory pain syndromes, rheumatoid arthritis, and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, as well as [insulin and glucose dysregulation in CFS patients](http://jme.endocrinology-journals.org/content/50/3/R75.short). These channels help detect heat and pain transmission, and dysregulation may lead to [generalized pain and central nervous system impairments without tissue damage](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10067-006-0433-9). [Incorrect thermoregulatory responses, including significantly more shivering, sweating, sudden change of skin color, and feeling unusually warm,](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/120/1/e129.short) have been reported in CFS patients.

These TRPM3 variants are more common in CFS patients versus the general population.

# What should I do about this?

CFS patients should be aware of their difficulty in maintaining a stable body temperature and avoid large temperature swings. Blood sugar should be checked regularly to avoid insulin and blood sugar issues.

Chronic pain relief may include:

- [Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14997317/) 
- [Tricyclic antidepressants](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19410099/) 
- [Gabapentin, duloxetine, or pregabalin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19410099/) 
- [Multidisciplinary pain management programs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22550986), such as [cognitive behavioral therapy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11166973/)

# High Risk

This variant causes [retinal dystrophy and iris coloboma with or without congenital cataract](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/218881/). Abnormalities include [adhesions between the iris and lens](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/488784), [visual impairment or vision loss](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/65889), and [retinal atrophy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/101075). It may also cause [decreased color vision, degradation of retinal veins, and congenital cataracts](http://www.malacards.org/card/retinal_dystrophy_and_iris_coloboma_with_or_without_congenital_cataract).

# What should I do about this?

Symptoms may improve after removal of cataracts, and should be monitored carefully to prevent further lens and iris adhesion due to [incorrect surgery](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19246951).
