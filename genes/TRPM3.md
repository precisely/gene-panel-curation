# What does the TRPM3 gene do?

TRPM3 (transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 3) controls [calcium channels](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9HCF6#expression). These channels help to detect temperature and pain to maintain homeostasis in the body, and incorrect function may lead to [generalized pain and central nervous system impairments](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10067-006-0433-9). Linked health issues include [cataracts, glaucoma](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-54215-2_17), [inflammatory pain syndromes, rheumatoid arthritis, and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines](http://jme.endocrinology-journals.org/content/50/3/R75.short). In ME/CFS patients, variants may be linked to [insulin and glucose dysregulation](http://jme.endocrinology-journals.org/content/50/3/R75.short), [multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.4137/III.S25147), [problems maintaining body temperature](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/120/1/e129.short), and [impaired natural killer cell (NKC) function, which may lead to increased inflammation and illness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27245705).

This gene is located on chromosome 9. The protein it creates acts in your brain and kidneys.

    Biological processes responsible for the varied symptoms reported for [ME/CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27835969) may involve ion channels and receptors that are located on cells throughout the body. These channels maintain homeostasis, and incorrect function has been linked to [chronic pain, overactive bladder, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiac hypertrophy, familial Alzheimer’s disease, skin diseases, neuropathy, and cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27835969). In CFS patients, TRP channels are targeted during inflammatory reactions, and may play a role in [multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.4137/III.S25147).

    TRPM3 channels transport calcium and zinc and incorrect function has been linked to [cataracts, glaucoma](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-54215-2_17), inflammatory pain syndromes, rheumatoid arthritis, and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, as well as [insulin and glucose dysregulation in CFS patients](http://jme.endocrinology-journals.org/content/50/3/R75.short). These channels help detect heat and pain transmission, and dysregulation may lead to [generalized pain and central nervous system impairments without tissue damage](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10067-006-0433-9). [Incorrect thermoregulatory responses, including significantly more shivering, sweating, sudden change of skin color, and feeling unusually warm,](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/120/1/e129.short) have been reported in CFS patients.

    Biological processes responsible for the varied symptoms reported for [ME/CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27835969) may involve ion channels and receptors that are located on cells throughout the body. These channels maintain homeostasis, and incorrect function has been linked to [chronic pain, overactive bladder, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiac hypertrophy, familial Alzheimer’s disease, skin diseases, neuropathy, and cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27835969). In CFS patients, TRP channels are targeted during inflammatory reactions, and may play a role in [multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.4137/III.S25147).

    TRPM3 channels transport calcium and zinc and incorrect function has been linked to [cataracts, glaucoma](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-54215-2_17), inflammatory pain syndromes, rheumatoid arthritis, and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, as well as [insulin and glucose dysregulation in CFS patients](http://jme.endocrinology-journals.org/content/50/3/R75.short).

    Biological processes responsible for the varied symptoms reported for [ME/CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27835969) may involve ion channels and receptors that are located on cells throughout the body. These channels maintain homeostasis, and incorrect function has been linked to [chronic pain, overactive bladder, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiac hypertrophy, familial Alzheimer’s disease, skin diseases, neuropathy, and cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27835969). In CFS patients, TRP channels are targeted during inflammatory reactions, and may play a role in [multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.4137/III.S25147).

    TRPM3 channels transport calcium and zinc and incorrect function has been linked to [cataracts, glaucoma](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-54215-2_17), inflammatory pain syndromes, rheumatoid arthritis, and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, as well as [insulin and glucose dysregulation in CFS patients](http://jme.endocrinology-journals.org/content/50/3/R75.short). These channels help detect heat and pain transmission, and dysregulation may lead to [generalized pain and central nervous system impairments without tissue damage](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10067-006-0433-9).

    Biological processes responsible for the varied symptoms reported for [ME/CFS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27835969) may involve ion channels and receptors that are located on cells throughout the body. These channels maintain homeostasis, and incorrect function has been linked to [chronic pain, overactive bladder, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiac hypertrophy, familial Alzheimer’s disease, skin diseases, neuropathy, and cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27835969). In CFS patients, TRP channels are targeted during inflammatory reactions, and may play a role in [multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.4137/III.S25147).

    TRPM3 channels transport calcium and zinc and incorrect function has been linked to [cataracts, glaucoma](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-54215-2_17), inflammatory pain syndromes, rheumatoid arthritis, and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, as well as [insulin and glucose dysregulation in CFS patients](http://jme.endocrinology-journals.org/content/50/3/R75.short). These channels help detect heat and pain transmission, and dysregulation may lead to [generalized pain and central nervous system impairments without tissue damage](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10067-006-0433-9). [Incorrect thermoregulatory responses, including significantly more shivering, sweating, sudden change of skin color, and feeling unusually warm,](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/120/1/e129.short) have been reported in CFS patients.

    These TRPM3 variants are more common in CFS patients versus the general population.

    Natural killer cells (NKC) are a type of white blood cells found in the blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes. They kill viral infected cells and tumorous cells. Many patients with ME/CFS have NK cells with lower functional ability to fight infections, and [this impairment is associated with illness severity](https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/about/possible-causes.html). Compared with the general population, CFS patients have half the cellular efficiency with a [17% cellular death rate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524). In CFS patients, TRPM3 variants cause [incorrect cell surface expression in NKC, as well as decreased intracellular calcium](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27245705).

    Natural killer cells (NKC) are a type of white blood cells found in the blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes. They kill viral infected cells and tumorous cells. Many patients with ME/CFS have NK cells with lower functional ability to fight infections, and [this impairment is associated with illness severity](https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/about/possible-causes.html). Compared with the general population, CFS patients have half the cellular efficiency with a [17% cellular death rate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524). In CFS patients, TRPM3 variants cause [incorrect cell surface expression in NKC, as well as decreased intracellular calcium](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27245705).

    The following variants decrease gene expression in both the DNA and RNA, causing significant reduction in NKC activity.

    # What should I do about this?

    Some pharmaceuticals may increase or decrease natural killer cell function:

    - [Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), including suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and valproic acid,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17349632/) impair NKC function and should be avoided. 
    - [Acyclovir, ganciclovir, and related prophylactic antiviral drugs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353) may improve cellular function. 
    - [Therapies for papillomaviruses, topical agents, physical approaches and immunostimulants,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353) may activate NK cells. 
    - [Cytokine therapies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353), such as [IFN-α](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/bio-therapies-fact-sheet) in CNKD1, may induce higher levels of NKC cytotoxic activity by [activating white blood cells](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/bio-therapies-fact-sheet). 
    - Consider the [HPV vaccine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353) as issues with natural killer cells cause higher susceptibility. 

    Many dietary supplements have been found to increase natural killer cell function:

    - [Resveratrol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4855330/) stimulates the immune system by increasing NKC activity, but sufficient body concentration can only be achieved through supplementation. 
    - [Myricetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075019), a flavonoid found in food and red wine, can increase NKC activity. 
    - [Quercetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19449452), a flavonoid in onions and fruits, may improve NKC and T cell function. 
    - [Bulgarian yogurt fermented with L. delbrueckii ssp. Bulgaricus augments NKC activity.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26686726) 
    - [Zinc](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27021581) helps to improve immune system activity and response. 
    - [Inositol hexaphosphate (IP6), found in germ, bran, and whole kernel corn](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11366552) may activate the immune system and help fight bacterial and fungal infections.

    Natural killer cells (NKC) are a type of white blood cells found in the blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes. They kill viral infected cells and tumorous cells. Many patients with ME/CFS have NK cells with lower functional ability to fight infections, and [this impairment is associated with illness severity](https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/about/possible-causes.html). Compared with the general population, CFS patients have half the cellular efficiency with a [17% cellular death rate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524). In CFS patients, TRPM3 variants cause [incorrect cell surface expression in NKC, as well as decreased intracellular calcium](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27245705).

    The following variants decrease gene expression in both the DNA and RNA, causing significant reduction in NKC activity.

    Your TRPM3 gene has no variants. A normal gene is referred to as a "wild-type" gene.

    # What is the effect of this variant?

    # Moderate Risk

    Natural killer cells (NKC) are a type of white blood cells found in the blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes. They kill viral infected cells and tumorous cells. Many patients with ME/CFS have NK cells with lower functional ability to fight infections, and [this impairment is associated with illness severity](https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/about/possible-causes.html). Compared with the general population, CFS patients have half the cellular efficiency with a [17% cellular death rate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099524). In CFS patients, TRPM3 variants cause [incorrect cell surface expression in NKC, as well as decreased intracellular calcium](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27245705).

    The following variants decrease gene expression in both the DNA and RNA, causing significant reduction in NKC activity.

    # What should I do about this?

    Some pharmaceuticals may increase or decrease natural killer cell function:

    - [Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), including suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and valproic acid,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17349632/) impair NKC function and should be avoided. 
    - [Acyclovir, ganciclovir, and related prophylactic antiviral drugs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353) may improve cellular function. 
    - [Therapies for papillomaviruses, topical agents, physical approaches and immunostimulants,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353) may activate NK cells. 
    - [Cytokine therapies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353), such as [IFN-α](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/bio-therapies-fact-sheet) in CNKD1, may induce higher levels of NKC cytotoxic activity by [activating white blood cells](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/bio-therapies-fact-sheet). 
    - Consider the [HPV vaccine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23993353) as issues with natural killer cells cause higher susceptibility. 

    Many dietary supplements have been found to increase natural killer cell function:

    - [Resveratrol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4855330/) stimulates the immune system by increasing NKC activity, but sufficient body concentration can only be achieved through supplementation. 
    - [Myricetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075019), a flavonoid found in food and red wine, can increase NKC activity. 
    - [Quercetin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19449452), a flavonoid in onions and fruits, may improve NKC and T cell function. 
    - [Bulgarian yogurt fermented with L. delbrueckii ssp. Bulgaricus augments NKC activity.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26686726) 
    - [Zinc](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27021581) helps to improve immune system activity and response. 
    - [Inositol hexaphosphate (IP6), found in germ, bran, and whole kernel corn](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11366552) may activate the immune system and help fight bacterial and fungal infections. 
    - [Arabinoxylan rice bran (MGN-3/Biobran](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25541298) increases activation and stimulates cell killing activity.
