# What are some common mutations of PTDSS1?
 
There is one well-known variant in PTDSS1: [A96338727G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=7010471).

<# A96338727G #>
 <Variant hgvs="CM000670.2:g.96338727A>G" name="A96338727G"> 

    This variant is a change at a specific point in the PTDSS1 gene from adenine (A) to guanine (G) resulting in incorrect protien function. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense variant.
 
</Variant>

<# A96338727G #>
 <Genotype hgvs="CM000670.2:g.[96338727A>G];[96338727=]" name="A96338727G"> 

     # What does this mean?
 
     People with this variant have one copy of the [A96338727G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=7010471) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

     # What is the effect of this variant?

     You are in the Moderate Loss of Function category. See below for more information.

     # What does this mean?

     People with this variant have two copies of the [A96338727G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=7010471) variant. This substitution of a single nucleotide is known as a missense mutation.

     # What is the effect of this variant?

     Your variant is not associated with any loss of function.
