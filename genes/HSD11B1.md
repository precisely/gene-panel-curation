# What are some common mutations of HSD11B1?
 
There are five common variants in HSD11B1: [C209711973A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=11119328), [T209714373C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=846906), [G209732389C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=932335), [LYS187ASN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/31589/), and [C409T (p.Arg137Cys)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/31588/).

# How do changes in HSD11B1 affect people?

For the vast majority of people, the overall risk associated with the common HSD11B1 variants is small and does not impact treatment. It is possible that variants in this gene interact with other gene variants, which is the reason for our inclusion of this gene.
