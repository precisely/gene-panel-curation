 # What are some common mutations of SCN9A?
 
There are six well known variants in SCN9A: [T166298928G](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=6754031), [C984A (Tyr328Ter)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/6363/), [C829T (Arg277Ter)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/6362/), [C2986T (Arg996Cys)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/6356/), [G2691A (Trp897Ter)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/6355/), and [G1376C (Ser459Ter)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/6353/).

# How do changes in SCN9A affect people?

For the vast majority of people, the overall risk associated with the common SCN9A variants is small, and do not impact treatment. It is possible that variants in this gene interact with other gene variants, which is the reason for our inclusion of this gene.
